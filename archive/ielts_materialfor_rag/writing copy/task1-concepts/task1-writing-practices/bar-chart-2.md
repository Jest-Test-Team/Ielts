The chart demonstrates the usage percentage of social media platform from Canadian Adults in 2023.

Overall, YouTube,Facebook,and Instagram occupied the majority of the Canadian adults’ social media platform usage percentage,individually.
While the numbers in this criteria of tiktok,X(twitter),LinkedIn, were all holding a relatively minor influences.

We can see that Youtube presented almost 90%(88%) usage percentage, which is the largest amount among all these platforms, even 4-times more than the usage ratio of LinkedIn.Followed by Facebook, slightly less than YouTube, showing almost 80%(79%), was still a very gigantic usage rate.Then Instagram, with approximately one quarter less than Facebook, showed the usage amount more than half(55%), which was more than the combination of X(twitter) and LinkedIn.These three platforms obviously dominated social media platforms in Canadian adults’ market.

On the other hand, tiktok just barely reached more than 40%(42%), less than half of youtube.Then X (Twitter), exactly a quarter, no more than a third of Facebook.Last, Linkedin, the one with lowest user rate, only got merely 21%, only a half of of Tiktok.while the total number of these three platforms with relatively low user usage was even lower than the ratio of YouTube,it’s clear that they have minor impact on Canadian adults’ digital social life.

詞彙資源 (Lexical Resource) - Band 6

- 優點 👍:
  - 你很努力地使用更多樣的詞彙，像是 demonstrates, occupied the majority, gigantic, dominated，這個嘗試非常值得鼓勵！
- 可改進之處 ✍️:
  - 用詞的精確性：這是你下一步要努力的重點。有些單字的選擇不太精確或不夠學術，我們來看看：
    - amount / ratio / usage amount：在描述百分比時，最好的詞是 percentage 或 proportion。Amount 通常指不可數的「量」。
    - gigantic usage rate：「gigantic」 (巨大的) 這個詞有點太口語和誇張，可以換成 a very high rate 或 a substantial percentage。
    - criteria：這個詞的意思是「標準」(單數是 criterion)，這裡應該用 figures (數字) 或 platforms。
    - user usage：有點重複，直接用 usage rate 或 user rate 就可以了。
    - combination of X and LinkedIn：可以說 the combined usage of X and LinkedIn。

  - 句型大躍進：和你上一篇相比，這次你使用了更多變的複雜句，特別是 which 引導的子句，這讓你的文法廣度大大提升！
- 可改進之處 ✍️:
  - 句子過長：有時候句子寫得太長，反而會讓結構變得有點混亂或出現小錯誤。例如：
    - We can see that Youtube presented almost 90%(88%) usage percentage, which is the largest amount among all these platforms, even 4-times more than the usage ratio of LinkedIn.
    - 這個句子包含了太多資訊，可以試著拆成兩句，會更清晰：
    - 拆分範例：We can see that YouTube presented the highest usage percentage at 88%. This figure was the largest among all platforms and was more than four times the rate of LinkedIn.
  - 小錯誤：
    - 4-times more than -> more than four times
    - Last, Linkedin -> Lastly, LinkedIn
    - a half of of Tiktok -> half of Tiktok (of 重複了)
