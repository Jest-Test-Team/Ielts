詳細分析

寫作任務回應 (Task Achievement) - Band 5

- 優點 👍:
  - 你成功地寫出了引言 (introduction) 和一個清晰的總覽 (overview)，正確地指出了最重要的和最不重要的因素。
  - 你引用了圖表中的數據來支持你的描述。
- 可改進之處 ✍️:
  - 字數不足：這是最主要的問題。文章要求至少 150 字，但你的文章大約只有 121 字。字數不足會直接導致這項評分很難超過 Band 5，因為這代表你沒有充分地發展你的論點。
  - 數據不精確：你提到設施的部分 barely reaching 10%，但實際數據是 8%。在 Task 1 中，準確地報告數據非常重要。

連貫與銜接 (Coherence and Cohesion) - Band 5

- 優點 👍:
  - 文章的四段式結構（引言、總覽、詳述一、詳述二）是正確的，讓讀者可以跟上你的思路。
- 可改進之處 ✍️:
  - 句子過於簡短：你的文章大多由非常簡短的句子組成，這讓文章讀起來有點斷斷續續，不夠流暢。例如：
    - There are 3 significant and noteworthy reasons among these reasons. Gooding teaching quality held the greatest amount of all the reasons, 45%.
    - 這兩句可以合併成一句更流暢的句子：Among the reasons cited, good teaching quality was the most significant, accounting for 45% of students.
  - 段落發展不足：你的兩個主體段落都太短了，更像是筆記而非完整的段落。你需要擴充句子，加入更多的比較來豐富內容。

詞彙資源 (Lexical Resource) - Band 5

- 優點 👍:
  - 你嘗試使用了一些同義詞，例如用 concerns 來替代 reasons。
- 可改進之處 ✍️:
  - 用詞重複且不夠精確：
    - reasons 這個字出現了太多次。
    - 描述百分比時，amount (數量) 不是最適合的詞，可以用 percentage 或 proportion。
    - held the greatest amount 可以換成更學術的 accounted for the highest percentage 或 was the most popular reason。
  - 拼字與用字錯誤：
    - Gooding teaching quality -> 應為 Good teaching quality。
    - Following by -> 應為 Followed by。
    - facilities’ qualities -> the quality of facilities 會更自然。
    - barely reaching 10% -> at just 8%。

文法廣度與準確性 (Grammatical Range and Accuracy) - Band 5

- 可改進之處 ✍️:
  - 句型單一：如前所述，文章缺乏複雜的句型變化。高分的 Task 1 需要使用到從屬子句 (e.g., using which, while) 來連接資訊。
  - 文法錯誤：
    - 主詞動詞一致性：distance and facilities is less -> distance and facilities **are** less (主詞是兩個東西)。
    - 最後一句的總結 To summarize, distance and facilities is less than a quarter of that in teaching qualities, suitable courses, and the reputation of this university. 句型結構比較混亂，且不太容易理解。

如何讓文章更好？(範例)

讓我們來試著改寫你的其中一段，看看可以如何擴充和改善：
你的原文：
There are 3 significant and noteworthy reasons among these reasons. Gooding teaching quality held the greatest amount of all the reasons, 45%.Following by suitable courses, almost 40%.Then the reputation of this university, slightly exceed 30%.
修改後的範例： Looking at the more significant factors, the quality of teaching was clearly the primary reason for students' decisions, cited by 45% of them. This was followed by the availability of suitable courses, which was the second most important factor at 38%. The university's reputation also played a crucial role, influencing nearly a third of the students (32%). Together, these three academic-related reasons were dominant.
你看，透過合併句子、使用不同的句型 (例如 which 子句) 和更精確的詞彙，整個段落變得更豐富、更流暢了。
總結建議： 你的思路是對的，但需要大膽地擴寫句子，把你想表達的資訊用更完整、更多樣的句型包裝起來。下次練習時，專注於：

1. 合併短句，創造更長的複合句。
2. 替換常用字，使用更精確的學術詞彙。
3. 寫完後，檢查字數是否達標
   改寫後的版本 (Rewritten Version)

The provided bar chart details the primary motivations behind students' choice of a particular UK university in the year 2021.
Overall, it is immediately clear that academic-related factors were the most influential reasons for choosing the university. In contrast, non-academic considerations such as proximity to home and the quality of facilities were significantly less important.
Looking at the main reasons, the quality of teaching was the most significant factor, cited by 45% of students. The availability of suitable courses was the second most common motivation, accounting for a slightly lower figure of 38%. Furthermore, the university's reputation also played a crucial role, being a key consideration for 32% of the respondents, or just under a third.
On the other hand, practical and lifestyle factors were far less critical in the decision-making process. Being close to their parental home was a motivation for only 15% of students. The least cited reason of all was the standard of sports and social facilities, which influenced a mere 8% of the student body. This figure was less than one-fifth of the percentage for teaching quality, highlighting its minor importance.

主要修改了哪些地方？

1. 句子更豐富 (Sentence Variety)：我將你原本的短句合併、擴充，變成了更長、更複雜的句子。例如，我用了 which was cited by... 和 which influenced... 這樣的子句來連接資訊。
2. 用詞更精準 (Vocabulary)：
   - reasons -> motivations, factors, considerations
   - show -> details, illustrates
   - important -> influential, significant, crucial, critical
   - 45% of students said... -> cited by 45% of students, accounting for 45%
3. 比較更明確 (Clearer Comparisons)：我在最後一句直接加入了一個比較 (less than one-fifth of the percentage for teaching quality)，這能有效地回應題目中 make comparisons where relevant 的要求。
4. 結構更流暢 (Better Flow)：使用了 Overall, In contrast, Furthermore, On the other hand 這些轉折詞，讓段落之間的邏輯關係更清楚。
5. 字數達標 (Word Count)：這份改寫後的文章大約有 170 字，完全符合要求。
