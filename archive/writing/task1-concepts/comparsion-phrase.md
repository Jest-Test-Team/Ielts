雅思 Task 1 精準比較範例庫


1. 倍數與分數比較 (Multiples and Fractions)

當數據之間存在明顯的倍數或分數關係時，一定要指出來。
* 數據範例:
    * A = 60%, B = 30%, C = 10%
* 範例句:
    * The figure for A (60%) was **twice as high as** the figure for B (30%). (A 的數字是 B 的兩倍高。)
    * The proportion of A was **double** that of B. (A 的比例是 B 的兩倍。)
    * The percentage for B (30%) was **three times the figure for** C (10%). (B 的百分比是 C 的三倍。)
    * Conversely, the figure for C was only **a third of** the figure for B. (相反地，C 的數字僅為 B 的三分之一。)
    * The rate for B (30%) was **exactly half** the rate for A (60%). (B 的比率正好是 A 的一半。)


2. 明顯的差距 (Significant Gaps)

當數據之間差距很大，但又不成整數倍時使用。
* 數據範例:
    * Fast food meals = 115 次
    * Sit-down meals = 60 次
* 範例句:
    * The number of fast food meals (115) was **significantly higher than** that of sit-down meals (60). (速食的次數顯著高於內用正餐。)
    * There was a **considerable gap** between the number of fast food meals and sit-down meals. (速食和內用正餐的次數之間存在相當大的差距。)
    * The consumption of fast food was **substantially greater than** that of sit-down meals. (速食的消費量遠大於內用正餐。)
    * The difference between the two categories **widened dramatically** after 1990. (在 1990 年後，這兩個類別的差距急遽擴大。)


3. 細微的差距 (Slight Gaps)

當數據非常接近時使用。
* 數據範例:
    * Men's poverty rate = 6%
    * Women's poverty rate = 7%
* 範例句:
    * The poverty rate for women (7%) was **marginally / slightly higher than** for men (6%). (女性的貧困率略高於男性。)
    * The figures for both genders were **almost the same**, with only a minimal difference of 1%. (兩個性別的數字幾乎相同，僅有 1% 的微小差異。)
    * The poverty rate for men **closely followed** that of women. (男性的貧困率緊隨女性之後。)


4. 最高級與排名 (Superlatives and Ranking)

用來描述數據中的極端值和順序。
* 數據範例:
    * Hiking = 80%, TV = 65%, Theatre = 45%
* 範例句:
    * Hiking was by far **the most popular** activity, at 80%. (健行是目前為止最受歡迎的活動，佔 80%。)
    * The **least common** activity was going to the theatre, with a figure of 45%. (最不常見的活動是去劇院，數字為 45%。)
    * The highest percentage was recorded for hiking, **followed by** watching TV at 65%. (最高的百分比記錄在健行，其次是看電視，為 65%。)
    * Watching TV **ranked second**, while going to the theatre was the least popular of the three. (看電視排名第二，而去劇院是三者中最不受歡迎的。)


5. 約數與估計 (Approximation)

當圖表數據不是精確整數時使用，展現語言的靈活性。
* 數據範例: 98,000 人
* 範例句:
    * The figure peaked at **approximately / roughly / around** 100,000. (數字在約 10 萬達到頂峰。)
    * The number of people reached **just under** 100,000. (人數達到略低於 10 萬。)
    * The population growth was **just over** 60,000. (人口增長略高於 6 萬。)
  「接近倍數」的精準比較範例


情境一：略低於整數倍 (Slightly Less than a Multiple)

* 數據範例:
    * A = 58, B = 20 (A 非常接近 B 的三倍)
* 範例句:
    * The figure for A (58) was **almost three times as high as** the figure for B (20). (A 的數字幾乎是 B 的三倍高。)
    * At 58, the value of A was **nearly three times** that of B. (A 的值為 58，將近 B 的三倍。)
    * The number of A was **approximately triple** the number of B. (A 的數量大約是 B 的三倍。)
    * The figure for A was **just short of being three times** the figure for B. (A 的數字差一點就是 B 的三倍。) - 這句更高級、更道地

情境二：略高於整數倍 (Slightly More than a Multiple)

* 數據範例:
    * A = 43, B = 20 (A 比 B 的兩倍多一點點)
* 範例句:
    * The figure for A (43) was **just over twice as high as** the figure for B (20). (A 的數字比 B 的兩倍高一點。)
    * At 43, the value of A was **slightly more than double** that of B. (A 的值為 43，比 B 的兩倍略多。)
    * The number of A was **a little more than twice** the number of B. (A 的數量比 B 的兩倍多一些。)

情境三：接近分數 (Approaching Fractions)

* 數據範例:
    * A = 26, B = 50 (A 非常接近 B 的一半)
* 範例句:
    * The number for A (26) was **almost half** the number for B (50). (A 的數量幾乎是 B 的一半。)
    * At 26, the figure for A was **roughly half** that of B. (A 的數字為 26，大約是 B 的一半。)
    * The proportion of A (26%) was **approximately a quarter of** the proportion of C (99%). (A 的比例約為 C 的四分之一。)
