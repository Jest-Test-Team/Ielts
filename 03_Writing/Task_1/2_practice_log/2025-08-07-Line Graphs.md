## üìà Chart Data

**Fast Food Consumption in Britain (1970-1990)**

*Data shows weekly spending on three types of fast foods over two decades*

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The line chart demonstrates the consumption amount on 3 types of fast foods per week in the UK in two decades, from 1970 to 1990. Overall, the expenditure amounts of hamburger and fish & chips showed relatively large and steady increase over this time period while pizza continued to decline except for last year.

We can see that in 1970, the expenditure amounts of hamburger and fish & chips both were below 100, which is less a third of the amount of pizza. Then from 1975 to 1980, situation remained similar, except for the amount of both these two types of foods steadily grew and the amount of pizza presented a relatively sharp decrease, making the total amount of hamburger and fish & chips just slightly exceeded the amount of pizza in 1980.

On the other hand, since 1980, expenditure amount on hamburger grew steadily and exceeded the amount of pizza, which demonstrated a slight decrease, in 1987, and showed a final amount just slightly below 300 in 1990. Which made the amount of pizza, though showing a very small increase in the same period, with the lowest amount of all types of foods. Furthermore, with continuous growth, the amount of fish & chips exceeded the amount of pizza, within two and half years, around 1984, and sharply increased to 500 in 1990, even more than two times of expenditure amount on pizza, and held the largest amount of all types of foods in 1990.

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Task Achievement** - Band 7.5

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Exceptional analysis:** Best analysis I've seen from you! Found two key crossover points and sophisticated observation
- **Clear focus:** Accurately captured trends for all three foods and final 1990 rankings

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**
- **Overview precision:** Mentioned pizza consumption "except for last year" but pizza started recovering from 1985

---

### **Coherence and Cohesion** - Band 8

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Excellent structure:** Time-based segmentation (1970-1980 and 1980-1990) strategy very effective for trend description

---

### **Lexical Resource & Grammar** - Band 6.5

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Successfully avoided old errors:** No more "was accounted for," "figure," "gigantic" - your "Error Notebook" strategy works!

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**
- **"Runaway long sentences" problem persists:** This is now your biggest challenge to reach 7.5+

## üí° How to Improve

### **The "Monster Sentence" Problem**

**Your long sentence:**
> Furthermore, with continuous growth, the amount of fish & chips exceeded the amount of pizza, within two and half years, around 1984, and sharply increased to 500 in 1990, even more than two times of expenditure amount on pizza, and held the largest amount of all types of foods in 1990.

**Problem analysis:** This sentence tries to express 6 information points simultaneously:
1. Continuous growth
2. Exceeding pizza
3. Crossover time
4. 1990 sharp increase
5. Multiple comparison with pizza
6. Final ranking

**"Slimmed down" version:**
> Furthermore, the expenditure on fish & chips continued to grow, exceeding that of pizza around 1984. Afterwards, its consumption increased sharply, reaching a peak of 500g in 1990. At this point, it was the most popular fast food of the three, with spending more than double that of pizza.

**Sentence fragments:**
- "Which made the amount of pizza..." - incomplete sentence starting with "Which"
- **Correction:** Connect to previous sentence: "..., making the amount of pizza..."

## üìù **Summary & Recommendations**

**Your path to 7.5 is crystal clear:** Master sentence control.

**Your challenge:** Not "can't think of ideas" but "thinking too much, can't fit into one sentence."

**Ultimate advice:** In next practice, force yourself to express only 1-2 core information points per sentence. When you want to continue with "and," "which," "with," stop and ask: "Can I put a period here and start a new sentence?"
