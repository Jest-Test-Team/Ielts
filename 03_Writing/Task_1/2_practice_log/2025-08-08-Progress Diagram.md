## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The chart presents a man-made process about producing bricks.

Overall, the process starts with obtain rough materials, clay, then transform it to usable format, which is products, by adding other ingredients and implementing machine-related steps. After that, the usable product will be packed and shift to customers.

Initially, all clay must be obtained from ground via digger. Next, with filtering controlled by a metal grid, valuable parts will fall on the roller and being sent to 2 types of brick making modules. And during this transfer, sand and water will be blended in and mixed with post-process clay, simultaneously. Then, two types of bricks will be produced, one is created by a hollow mould, while the other one is made by wire cutter splitting. After that, all these bricks are transferred into a drying oven for 1 to 2 days.

Once the drying stage's time requirement is fulfilled, then the bricks will be shift to heating stage, from moderate sub-stage (200-980 Celsius degree) to high sub-stage (870-1300 Celsius degree) temperature, and lastly cooling chamber, and stays for 2 to 3 days. Finally, after the required cooling time period is satisfied, the bricks can be packed then be placed on vehicles, and be delivered to customer.

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Task Achievement** - Band 8

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Zero errors!** Perfectly executed our "Priority 1: Eliminate Fatal Errors" plan
- **Complete content:** From digging clay to final delivery, no key steps missed

---

### **Coherence and Cohesion** - Band 8

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Excellent logic:** Very smart to separate "raw material processing" and "high-temperature processing" into different paragraphs
- **Skilled transitions:** Used many sequence words (Initially, Next, Then, After that, Once, Finally) effectively

---

### **Lexical Resource & Grammar** - Band 6.5

#### ‚úÖ **Worthy Progress:**
- **Successfully identified and used "Passive Voice":** Process diagrams focus on "items" (bricks), not "people." You wisely realized passive voice is needed (e.g., clay must be obtained, bricks are transferred)

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Refinement:**

**1. Passive Voice "Form":**
- **Formula:** Passive Voice = be verb + past participle (p.p.)
- **Your errors:**
  - "...and being sent to..." ‚Üí "...and **are sent** to..." (are + past participle sent)
  - "...bricks will be shift to..." ‚Üí "...bricks will be **shifted** to..." (be + past participle shifted)

**2. Vocabulary Collocation "Naturalness":**
- "rough materials" ‚Üí "raw materials"
- "shift to customers" ‚Üí "delivered/shipped to customers"
- "machine-related steps" ‚Üí "mechanical stages"
- "time requirement is fulfilled" ‚Üí "Once this stage is complete"
