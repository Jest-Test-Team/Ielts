## üìà Chart Data

**House Town Development (1986 vs 2006)**

*Map shows urban development changes over two decades*

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The map presents the processing evolution in House town for 2 decades.

Overall, lots of development occurred, while farmland area disappeared.

In 1986, we can see that in the north east of the town, with a bridge sit in the most northern location and next to the River Stroke, which located the most eastern place, there some houses, shops, and post office. Just below these, there is a large farming area. As for north east, another huge farming area stood, with some houses next to it in the west. A little south from these, there were primary school and a mansion with gardens. While by present, the most northern location is still guarded by the bridge, and the location of River Stroke remains the same. But the farmlands in west south area and east north area are removed, with more houses replacing them. The mansion is converted into a retirement house, which with no gardens. Primary school and Post office still stand, while the former one is enlarged. The shops are now full pulled down.

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Task Achievement** - Band 8

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Zero omissions, zero errors:** Precisely identified all key changes on map
- **Comprehensive observations:** Farmland disappearance, shop demolition, mansion conversion, school expansion, and new housing/roads

---

### **Coherence and Cohesion** - Band 8

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Perfect structure:** Classic and most effective map writing structure: "Introduction ‚Üí Overview ‚Üí Past map description ‚Üí Present changes description"

---

### **Lexical Resource & Grammar** - 6.0 ~ 6.5

#### ‚úÖ **Worthy Progress:**
- **Successfully used passive voice again:** "farmlands ... are removed, mansion is converted" - equally important in map questions!

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Refinement:**

**1. Map Question "Tense Magic":**
- **Challenge:** Map questions (especially past vs. present comparison) require flexible tense switching like a time traveler
- **Past description (1986):** Use Past Simple
  - **Your writing:** "there some houses, shops..."
  - **Correction:** "there **were** some houses and shops..."
- **Present description:** Can use Present Simple
  - **Your writing:** "the most northern location is still..." (correct!)
- **"From past to present changes":** Most precise tense is Present Perfect, especially passive voice
  - **Your writing:** "the farmlands ... are removed, The mansion is converted..."
  - **More precise:** "The farmlands **have been removed**, The large house **has been converted**..."

**2. "Sentence Slimming" Plan Needs Continuation:**
- **Your long sentence:** "In 1986, we can see that in the north east of the town, with a bridge sit in the most northern location and next to the River Stroke, which located the most eastern place, there some houses, shops, and post office."
- **Problem:** This sentence tries to describe all geographical locations and buildings at once, causing very confusing structure
- **"Slimmed down" version:**
  > In 1986, the town was located next to the River Stoke, which ran along the eastern side. A bridge crossed the river in the north. Near the bridge, there was a cluster of buildings including some houses, shops, and a post office.
