## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The line graph demonstrates 5 different ways for elders in the USA to spend their free time from 1980 to 2010.

Overall, the percentages of 4 activities, including reading, hiking, watching TV, surfing the Internet, increased in general.

While the percentages of going to a theatre decreased slightly.

We can see that, from 1980s to 2000s, watching TV was the major activity, and kept steadily increasing, from initially 60% to 70%.

And hiking increased sharply, from initially accounted for 20% to 60%.

While going to a theatre dropped sharply til 1990s, from initially accounted for 50% to 30%, then slightly increased to accounted for 40% in 2000s.

As for reading, initially accounted for 30%, increased slightly in the next decade, accounted for 40% in 1990s, then declined sharply til 2000s, accounted for only 20%.

And surfing the Internet, grew steadily till 2000s, from initially accounted for about 5% to around 15%.

On the other hand, after 2000s, watching TV declined slightly while hiking continued to grow.

Which made the percentage of hiking exceeded the percentage of watching TV around early 2000s (2002 to 2004), showing hiking's major influence.

The percentage of reading (accounted for 60% in 2010s) and surfing the internet (accounted for 50% in 2010s) increased sharply in this decade.

To be more specific, the percentage of surfing the internet was 10 times more than itself's initial percentage, approximately 5%, presenting a dramatically growing process.

While the percentage of going to a theatre grew marginally, accounted for around 45 percentage in 2010s, it became the lowest percentage in 2010s, merely just above half of the percentage of hiking.

And showed going to a theatre's minor influence, in 2010s.

## üìä Assessment Results

### Overall Band Score: **7.0**

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Task Achievement & Coherence (TA & CC - Band 7.5 ~ 8.0)**

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**

**Perfect Analysis, Zero Errors!** Your Task Achievement performance this time was perfect (Band 8.0). Your overview accurately summarized all trends, and all data and trend descriptions in your article were completely accurate. You also added some excellent comparisons, such as Internet increasing by 10 times, which was very impressive!

**Clear Structure, Back on Track:** You again used a clear time-based segmentation method (before 2000 vs. after 2000), and most sentences maintained concise control, making your article logical and easy to read.

---

### **Vocabulary & Grammar (LR & GRA - Band 6.0 ~ 6.5)**

You have successfully rebuilt your writing foundation. Now, we need to deal with a few "old enemies" that are still stubbornly resisting. Once we solve them, your score can stabilize at 7.5 or higher.

#### **Enemy #1: Sentence Fragments**

**Problem:** This old issue has returned. "Which made..." and "And showed..." are both incomplete sentences.

**Why fatal?** This is a very typical grammar error below Band 7. When examiners see this type of error, they immediately lower your grammar accuracy rating.

**Solution (Please add to your "Error Notebook"):**

| ‚ùå **Incorrect** | ‚úÖ **Correct** |
|------------------|----------------|
| Which made... | ..., which made... |
| And showed... | ..., showing... |

**Rule:** In academic writing, never start independent sentences with "Which" (unless it's a question). Verbs ending in -ing (like "Showing...") cannot independently constitute a sentence.

---

#### **Enemy #2: "Awkward Phrases"**

**Problem:** The phrase "major/minor influence" has appeared again. While it's grammatically correct, it's very vague and awkward when used here.

**Why not good?** Examiners want to see you describe the impact specifically. What is "major influence"? Is it "most popular" or "fastest growing"?

**More precise alternatives:**

| ‚ùå **Vague** | ‚úÖ **Specific** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| ...showing hiking's major influence | ..., **making hiking the most popular activity by 2010** |
| ...showed going to a theatre's minor influence | ..., **making it the least popular activity among the five** |

## üìù **Summary & Final Mission**

This practice is a huge success. You've proven that last time's 5.5 score was just an accident, and your true level is far beyond that. Your analytical ability has reached the top level, and sentence structure has basically returned to the right track.

Your final mission to reach 7.5+ is very clear:

**In your next practice, please act as a "Grammar Police Officer," focusing on hunting down these two criminals:**

1. **Sentence fragments** (Which..., Showing...)
2. **Vague phrases** (major/minor influence)

**You are very, very close to your goal. Let's complete this final polishing and achieve higher scores!**

## üí° **Key Learning Points**

- **Your analysis skills are excellent** - you've reached Band 8 level
- **Sentence control is improving** - continue with short sentence strategy
- **Focus on precision** - eliminate these final grammar enemies

*Remember: You're almost there! Just a few more targeted improvements and you'll reach your full potential.* üöÄ‚ú®
