## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The charts give information about arrested number for both males and females over 5 years, and 7 types of most recent arrests reason.

In general, more males were arrested than females were. And public drink was the most frequent arrest reason, and drinking driving, a similar reason, was also a majority types of arrest reason.

We can see that the percentage of public drinking type arrest was relatively higher than other's, with men made up around 30 percent and about 37.5% from ladies.

Following with drink driving, which females made up around 25 percent and about slightly below 15 from males.

Next, we can observe that assault type had more females were involved in than males were, just slightly below 20% versus merely over 15.

While these 3 types, contrarily, shared alike feature, more males in involved in than females were.

Men made up more than 15 percent in Breach type while less than 15% from women. And males made up just above 15% in theft type while less than 15% from women.

Also, males made up just below 20% in other reasons type, which is marginally more than females' percentage.

Finally, with no answer type, merely about just above 10% in total, showed a relatively insignificant impact compared to public drinking type.

While percentage of public drinking type is almost 5 times more than the percentage of no answer type.

On the other hand, generally speaking, more males were arrested than females were.

32% of males were arrested, while only 9% of females were arrested, over 5 years.

The arrested percentage of males was nearly four times than the percentage of females.

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Critical Error #1: Completely Reversed Data (Task Achievement - Band 4.5)**

This is the most core and serious problem in this writing. You almost completely reversed the male-female data in the entire bar chart.

#### **Problem Analysis:**

**Regarding Drink Driving:**
- **Your writing:** Females (about 25%) more than males (about 15%)
- **Chart reality:** Exactly the opposite. Males (about 26%) clearly higher than females (about 13%)

**Regarding Assault:**
- **Your writing:** Females more than males
- **Chart reality:** Still opposite. Males (about 18%) higher than females (about 15%)

#### **Why Fatal?**

In IELTS Task 1, accurately reporting data is the most basic and core requirement. When you completely reverse key data, the content of this article loses meaning. This is not a small flaw, but a fundamental error that will directly drop your TA score below 5.

---

### **Critical Issue #2: Chaotic Article Structure (Coherence and Cohesion - Band 5.0)**

#### **Problem Analysis:**

Your article structure is very chaotic. You spent a long time describing the bar chart, then at the very end of the article, used an independent paragraph to describe the pie chart. This makes the pie chart information look like a suddenly appearing supplement rather than an organic component of the article.

**Better structure should be:**

| Paragraph | Purpose | Content |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **1. Introduction** | Sets the stage | Brief overview of both charts |
| **2. Overall** | Summarizes key findings | Two most important discoveries (e.g., male arrest rate much higher than female; public drinking is main reason) |
| **3. Detail Pie Chart** | Describes pie chart | Detailed description of 32% vs 9% comparison |
| **4. Detail Bar Chart** | Describes bar chart | Detailed description of various arrest reason data, can group comparisons (e.g., reasons with higher female rates vs reasons with higher male rates) |

---

### **Language Expression Issues (LR & GRA - Band 5.5)**

Your short sentence strategy wasn't strictly implemented this time, but the main problem lies in accuracy and collocation.

| ‚ùå **Incorrect** | ‚úÖ **Correct** |
|------------------|----------------|
| arrested number | the percentage of people arrested |
| arrests reason | reasons for arrest |
| Following with | Followed by |
| more males in involved in | more males were involved in |

## üìù **Summary & "Disaster Recovery" Plan**

This 5.0 score is a very important wake-up call. It tells us: all advanced vocabulary and sentence patterns are pale and powerless in the face of incorrect data.

We must now return to the most core first step of our battle plan and upgrade it.

**Battle Plan 6.0: Absolute Accuracy**

### **Mandatory "Out-loud Pre-reading" Step Before Writing:**

**Action:** Before writing any paragraph, point at the chart with your finger and softly say the data and comparisons you're about to write.

**Example:** "Okay, public drinking, females higher than males. Drink driving, males higher than females. Assault, males higher than females..."

**Purpose:** This action forces your brain to conduct a "fact-check," which can 100% prevent you from making data reversal errors again.

### **Plan First, Structure Supreme:**

Before writing, spend 30 seconds writing your four-paragraph outline on draft paper. For example: P1-Intro, P2-Overall, P3-Pies, P4-Bar. This ensures your article structure is clear.

## üí° **Key Learning Points**

- **Data accuracy is fundamental** - all other skills depend on it
- **Structure planning is crucial** - plan before you write
- **Verification methods work** - use the "out-loud pre-reading" technique
