Writing Task 1 Table Sample

You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.

The Table below shows the results of a survey that asked 6800 Scottish adults (aged 16 years and over) whether they had taken part in different cultural activities in the past 12 months.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.

Write at least 150 words.

answer

___


The table gives information about a survey including if any cultural activities are participated  and the types these activities by 6,800 Scottish people aging no less than 16 years old last year.


Overall , computer based and writing activities were obviously less popular than other types of activities, while musical, acting, and dancing related activities occupied greatest popularity.


We can see that the percentage for both writing and computer based activities were less than 10% for Scottish people older than 25.

While the percentage for same activities types was marginally higher for  Scottish people aging 16-24, which was 17% for writing and exact 10% for computer based ones.

However, the average participating percentage of these two types of activities for all ages in the table was 7%, for writing type, and 6 % , for computer based type, which leads to 13% in total, merely just below the percentage of visual arts, exact 15%.


On the other hand, musical, acting, and dancing related activities accounted for 22% in all ages, more than triple of writing and computer based activities.

Followed by craft type, which held 19 %, just below 20%, then cultural purchases activities, accounted for 16%, only 1% higher than the percentage of visual arts, accounted for 15%.

These activities were all above 10%, showing greater popularity than computer based and writing activities.

Overall Estimated Band Score: 6.5

## Detailed Analysis

Grammar & Cohesion (GRA & CC): Band 7.0 - 8.0

    Strengths üëç:

        Flawless Sentence Control: Your sentence discipline is now a major strength. The sentences are clear, controlled, and you have completely eliminated sentence fragments.

        Logical Paragraphing: The structure you chose (grouping by least popular vs. most popular activities) is logical in itself and easy to follow.

Task Achievement (TA): Band 5.5 (The Main Weakness)

This is where the essay runs into problems. While the numbers you reported are correct, you failed to identify and describe the most important features and trends in the data.

    The "Missed Story":
    The most important feature of this table is not just which activities are popular overall, but how that popularity changes dramatically with age. The data shows two clear, opposing trends which you did not mention.

        Trend 1 (Activities popular with the young): Participation in Performance (from 35% down to 17%), Visual Arts (30% down to 11%), and Writing (17% down to 5%) decreases significantly as people get older.

        Trend 2 (Activities popular with older adults): In complete contrast, participation in Crafts (from 11% up to 22%) and Cultural Purchases (11% up to 18%) increases with age.

    Why This Is a Problem:
    The core of Task 1 is to "report the main features." These two opposing trends are the main features. By focusing your second body paragraph almost entirely on the "All aged 16 and over" column (which is just an average), you missed the opportunity to describe this crucial age-related story, which is essential for a high TA score.

## Action Plan: Becoming a "Data Storyteller"

You have completely mastered the technical side of writing sentences. Your next challenge is to master the analytical side of choosing the best "story" to tell.

A Better Structure for This Essay Would Have Been:

    Introduction

    Overview (Mentioning that participation in some activities decreases with age, while in others it increases).

    Body Paragraph 1: Describe the activities that are more popular with younger people (Performance, Visual Arts, etc.), using the numbers from each age column to show the clear downward trend.

    Body Paragraph 2: Describe the activities that become more popular with age (Crafts, Purchases), again using the data to prove the upward trend.

Your New Mission:
Before you start writing, after you've read the chart, ask yourself this question: "What is the most interesting pattern or contrast in this data?" Is it a change over time? A difference between men and women? Or, in this case, two opposite trends across different age groups?

Finding that "story" first is the key to unlocking a top-tier Task Achievement score. Your language skills are ready for it.
