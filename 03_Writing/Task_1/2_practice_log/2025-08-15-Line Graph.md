## üìà Chart Data

**Metal Price Changes in 2014**

*Data shows monthly percentage changes for Copper, Nickel, and Zinc*

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The line graph gives information about the average monthly change in the prices of Cooper, Nickel, and Zinc, three different types of metal in 2014.

Overall, the price growth rate of Nickel declined sharply and the price growth rate of Cooper declined slightly, while the price growth rate of Zinc increased marginally in 2014.

We can see that the price growth rate per month of Nickel, initially accounted for 6% in January, dramatically dropped to -3% in June, showing a large downward trend.

As for the price growth rate per month of Zinc, initially accounted for 1% in January, slightly increased for a month, reaching 3% in February, then sharply declined to -1% in June.

While the price growth rate per month of Cooper, initially accounted for 2% in January, declined steadily to around -0.5% in June, making the price growth rate per month of Cooper declined the least among all the metals in June.

After June, the price growth rate per month of Zinc fluctuated slightly, around -1% to -0.5%, for a quarter of year, then sharply increased to 2% in December.

And which became the highest price growth rate per month among all 3 metals, showing its demand degree may be the largest in the end of 2014.

As for Nickel, the price growth rate per month of Nickel first increased sharply to -1%, then remained at it for 2 months, followed by a slight decrease, then finally sharply increased to 1% and remained that percentage.

By which may represent the demand degree on Nickel was the lowest in the end of 2014.

On the other hand, the price growth rate per month of Cooper, first increased sharply to 1%, then remained at that percentage for two months.

And followed by a marginally two-month decline to approximately 0.5% in November, then grew to around 1.5%.

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Outstanding Achievement: Complete Chart Comprehension! üéØ**

**Most Praiseworthy Highlight:** You completely understood this complex chart!

The Y-axis of this chart is "price change percentage (% change)," not "price." Many people would misinterpret it as "Nickel prices fell continuously before June."

But you accurately used the term "price growth rate," proving you completely understood: lines above 0 represent price increases (just at different speeds), and lines below 0 represent price decreases. This is a very high-level analytical ability - I must give you huge praise!

However, precisely because your analytical ability is strong, some basic errors this time seem particularly regrettable, limiting your score to 6.5.

### **Critical Error #1: Violating Task 1 Golden Rule (TA - Band 6.5)**

#### **Problem:**
You added sentences like:
- "...showing its demand degree may be the largest..."
- "...may represent the demand degree on Nickel was the lowest..."

#### **Why Fatal?**
This violates IELTS Task 1's **Golden Rule**: Always describe only the data you see, never explain the reasons behind the data or make any speculation. Your task is to be a "data reporter," not an "economic analyst." Adding any subjective speculation (like "demand degree") will be seen as task failure (off-topic), seriously affecting your TA score.

**Action Note:** In your battle plan, write in red: **"Task 1: Describe only, don't explain!"**

---

### **Critical Error #2: Keyword Spelling Error (LR - Band 5.5)**

#### **Problem:**
Throughout your article, you misspelled "Copper" (ÈäÖ) as "Cooper."

#### **Why Fatal?**
Repeatedly misspelling keywords given in the question is a very basic and serious spelling error. This will make examiners extremely suspicious of your vocabulary accuracy, directly lowering your LR score.

**Action Note:** Our "30-second rapid check method" now needs a new item: verify that all key nouns in the question are spelled correctly.

### **Language Expression Challenges (GRA - Band 6.5)**

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
**Short Sentence Strategy Success!** Your sentence length control was excellent, making the article clear and readable. Please continue to maintain this!

#### ‚ùå **Old Problems:**
**Sentence Fragments (Which...)** have returned. "And which became..." and "By which may represent..." are incomplete sentences. This is now your most stubborn grammar enemy - we must eliminate it completely next time.

**Correction:** ..., which became... and ..., which may represent...

## üìù **Summary & New Battle Plan**

This practice is very valuable, clearly showing us several "game rules" of Task 1.

**Battle Plan 3.0: Follow Rules, Pursue Excellence**

1. **Follow Rule 1:** Describe only, don't explain. Remove all subjective speculation like "may be..., this shows..." from your Task 1 writing.

2. **Follow Rule 2:** Spelling must be accurate. Add "verify keyword spelling" to your final checklist.

3. **Eliminate Old Problems:** Next practice, after writing, use Word or other tools' search function to specifically search for "Which" in your article, checking if they're all correctly connected with commas to the previous sentence.

- **Your analysis skills are excellent** - you understood complex concepts perfectly
- **Follow Task 1 rules strictly** - describe, don't explain
- **Spelling accuracy matters** - always verify keywords
- **Continue short sentence strategy** - it's working well
