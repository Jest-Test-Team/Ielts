The diagram depicts the production process of bamboo fabric.


In general, 9 steps are included in the pipeline of bamboo fabric manufacturing.


Start with planting bamboo plants, which is required being done in spring, then harvesting the plants in autumn.

After these 2 steps, sitting the plants into strips will be step 3Followed by step 4, crushing the strips in order to make the rough materials into pulp in liquid status.


And then step 4, filtering crushed liquid pulps will be required, to ensure long fibers and liquid as well as other materials are separated.

Next, the fibers will be softened with water and amino acids oxide added, as step 6.

As for step 7, the post-softened fibers will then be made into spins, which will then be weaved for making fabric in step 8.

And finally, the fabrics from last step will eventually transformed into various products, such as clothes and soxes.

Overall Estimated Band Score: 6.5

## Detailed Analysis

Coherence and Cohesion: Band 8.0

    Strengths 👍: Your four-paragraph structure is perfect. You have a clear introduction and overview, and you've logically split the process into two halves for your two body paragraphs. Your use of sequencing words (Start with..., After..., Next..., Finally...) is also very good.

Task Achievement: Band 6.0

    Strengths 👍: You have correctly identified all nine steps in the process and reported them in the correct order.

    Areas for Improvement (Data Precision) ✍️: Your TA score is limited by several small but important inaccuracies in reporting the details from the diagram.

        You wrote sitting the plants instead of cutting.

        You wrote amino acids oxide instead of the correct amine oxide.

        You spelled soxes instead of socks.

        Your overview is a bit weak. It just counts the number of steps. A stronger overview would summarize the overall purpose, for example: "Overall, the process is a linear, multi-stage manufacturing pipeline that transforms raw bamboo plants into finished textile goods through a series of mechanical and chemical treatments."

Lexical Resource & Grammar (LR & GRA): Band 5.5 - 6.0

This is the main area where the essay needs improvement. You have correctly identified that you need to use the passive voice, which is great! However, you are making frequent errors in the vocabulary and grammar required for this task.

    1. Vocabulary (Word Forms for Textiles)

        The Problem: You used incorrect word forms for the textile-making process.

        The Fix: Here are the correct terms to memorize for this type of diagram:

            The verb is spin -> The passive is is spun -> The noun (product) is yarn or thread.

            The verb is weave -> The passive is is woven -> The noun (product) is fabric.

        Your Error: made into spins should be spun into yarn. be weaved should be be woven.

    2. Grammar (Mastering the Passive Voice)

        The Problem: You are making errors in the structure of the passive voice.

        The Fix: Remember the formula: Passive = be verb + Past Participle.

        Your Error: You wrote the fabrics from last step will eventually transformed.... You are missing the be verb. It should be ...will eventually **be** transformed....

        Pro Tip: For describing a general, factual process like this, the Simple Present Passive (e.g., The skin **is cut**..., The fibres **are softened**...) is the most common and effective tense to use.

## Action Plan: Mastering the Process Diagram

You have perfected the structure. Now, the final step for process diagrams is to master the specific vocabulary and grammar they require.

    Memorize Key Verbs: Add the correct forms of spin/spun and weave/woven to your vocabulary notebook.

    Drill the Passive Voice: When proofreading your next process diagram essay, double-check every passive verb to ensure it has a be verb (is, are, will be) and the correct past participle form.

    Be a "Data Sniper": Remember that accuracy applies to words and chemical names from the diagram, not just numbers.

These are very specific, technical skills, and I am confident you can master them quickly.
