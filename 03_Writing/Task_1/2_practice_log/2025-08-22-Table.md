answer

____


The chart depicts the proportion of expenditure of income per household monthly , which is categorized in 4 groups,  in five European countries.


Overall, food and drink  as well as housing expenditures are major types in all these countries, while clothing and entertainment are relatively minor.


We can see that, housing accounted for more than 30% in France,Germany and Uk, also with 20 % in Turkey and 18% in Spain, can be considered the largest amount of spending generally, averaged for around 27.8%, just below 30%.

Followed by food and drinking, averaged for approximately a third, 33.6%,  while turkey and Spain both accounted for more than 30% as well as the percentages of other countries , though held relatively lower percentage, still all exceed 20%.

By these statistic numbers, it‚Äôs clear that food and drink  as well as housing spendings show great impact to these households in financial aspect.


On the other hand, entertainment averagely accounted  for 13.6%, and clothing, averagely accounted  for 10.6% , just marginally above 10%, both are lower than 20%, furthermore, not any single percentage in these types and countries  is more than 20%.

As a result, these two expenditure types could be considered to have less impact to these households financially.

## Detailed Analysis

Coherence and Cohesion: Band 7.0

    Strengths üëç: Your structure is excellent. Grouping the data into "major expenditures" (Housing, Food & drink) and "minor expenditures" (Entertainment, Clothing) is a very clear and logical way to organize this table.

Grammar and Vocabulary (GRA & LR): Band 6.5

    The Return of the "Monster Sentence": After several essays with excellent sentence control, one very long, uncontrolled sentence has reappeared in your first body paragraph:

        Your sentence: Followed by food and drinking, averaged for approximately a third, 33.6%, while turkey and Spain both accounted for more than 30% as well as the percentages of other countries , though held relatively lower percentage, still all exceed 20%.

        The Problem: This sentence is over 40 words long and crams at least four different ideas together, making it very difficult to read and grammatically convoluted.

        The Lesson: This is a powerful reminder that the "25-Word Iron Law" requires constant vigilance. One long sentence can disrupt the clarity of an otherwise well-written paragraph.

    Minor Vocabulary Issues:

        spendings should be the uncountable form, spending.

        averagely should be the phrase on average.

Task Achievement: Band 6.0 (The Main Weakness)

Your analysis shows good thinking, but it's undermined by a significant factual error and a lack of specific detail.

    1. The Calculation Error:

        The Problem: Your attempt to calculate the averages is a high-level skill, but the calculation for the largest category was incorrect. You stated the average for Food & Drink was 33.6%.

        The Correct Calculation: (25 + 22 + 27 + 36 + 31) / 5 = 141 / 5 = 28.2%.

        The Impact: In Task 1, factual accuracy is everything. An error in a key piece of data you've chosen to highlight will significantly limit your TA score. This is precisely what our "Data Sniper" mission is designed to prevent.

    2. Lack of Specificity (The Next Level of Analysis):

        While using averages is a good way to see the big picture, a top-tier essay also points out the extremes (the highest and lowest points).

        Example of a higher-level detail: After stating the averages, you could add a sentence like, "Notably, the UK spent the most on housing at 37%, while in contrast, Spain spent the least at only 18%." This adds a layer of specific, comparative detail that makes your analysis much stronger.

## Action Plan: Precision and Consistency

This essay shows your skills are becoming more advanced, but with new techniques come new challenges.

    Double-Check All Calculations: If you choose to use an advanced technique like calculating an average, you must make it part of your "30-Second Final Check" to verify that the math is correct.

    Maintain Sentence Discipline: Stay vigilant against the "monster sentence." Your strength lies in the clear, controlled sentences you have mastered. Don't let them slip.

    Highlight the Highs and Lows: When describing data, don't just give the average; also point out the most significant and least significant figures to show you can identify key data points.
