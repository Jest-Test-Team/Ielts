| Coal | 28% | 17% |
| Gas | 22% | 23% |
| Nuclear | 17% | 11% |
| Renewables | 9% | 16% |
| Other | 6% | 3% |

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The pie chart demonstrates different types of energy production (6 in total), in 2 separate years, 2008 and 2017.

Overall, fossil related genres (like oil, coal, or gas), present a trend of decrease, or at least very marginally increase. While others, like nuclear, renewables, show a noteworthy trend of increase.

We can see that production of coal dropped by 9%, which is the largest decreasing figure in all types. Followed by oil, a 4 percent loss, slightly below half of the decline rate of coal. On the other hand, gas, the only fossil type occupied increasing rate of production, though only rose by 1%, still make it become one of the 2 largest energy production types (oil and gas, both held 23%) in Spain, 2017. Though experiencing a sharp decline, from accounted slightly more the 3 quarters to merely over 60%, fossil types of energy still provide more than a half of total energy production in Spain for both 2008 and 2017.

By comparison, non-fossil types all increased in different degrees. Renewables showed a 7% growing rate in this decade, which is the largest one among all genres. At the same time, nuclear also occupied a competitive growing rate, 6%, almost as much as the increasing figure of renewables, and thus making it hold same portion as coal does in all types in Spain, 2017. Finally, other types showed a 3% growth rate, and was still the energy type with lowest portion in all types in Spain, both 2008 and 2017. Although non-fossil types generally got relatively significant growth rate in this decade, their sum of rising figure in 2017 was still lower than half and slightly below 40% (39%).
