## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The graph presents thefts per thousand vehicles in four countries from 1990 to 1999.

Overall, in this decade, the figure of theft in the UK continued to fluctuate, and then kept dropping till the end of 1999. While the figure showed climbing trending in Sweden, and decreasing in both France and Canada. From 1990 to 1992, the number of vehicles theft rose slightly from around 17 to 20, then repeated this cycle again in the next 3 years in the UK, with the highest figure of vehicles theft among all 4 countries. Followed by Sweden, though experienced a marginal decrease in the begging of this decade, the figure continued to increase steadily to around 10, while France and Canada shared a similar pattern, dropped till 1993 then rose till 1995. The UK showed a major impact by presenting almost the same figure as the combination of all other countries in these five years, while Canada with minor impact by holding merely approximately a quarter of the figure that the UK did.

In the second part on the decade, which is 1995 to 1999, we can see that the UK experienced a steady decline, but still owned the largest figure in all countries, accounted for around 37%, just slightly below 40% in 1999, the last year. Meanwhile, Sweden showed an overall increasing and reached approximately 14 at last, which is almost three times more than itself in 1990. France, on the other hand, continued to drop, and sendup with almost the same figure that Canada held in 1999, while Canada kept slowly growing, around 6 for both countries, which was just slightly above 10% in total.

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Task Achievement** - Band 5

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Successfully summarized main trends for four countries in overview
- Good choice of time-based structure for organization

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**
- **Critical data interpretation errors:** Major issue requiring special attention

---

### **Coherence and Cohesion** - Band 7

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Excellent structure:** "Introduction ‚Üí Overview ‚Üí First half period ‚Üí Second half period" organization is very logical

---

### **Lexical Resource & Grammar** - Band 6.0

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**

**1. New "Fossilized Errors":**
- **Problem:** Used "leftest" and "rightest" - these words don't have comparative/superlative forms in English
- **Correction:** Use "on the far left/right" or "on the westernmost/easternmost side"

**2. Tense Usage Could Be More Precise:**
- **Problem:** Didn't fully apply "Map Question Tense Magic" discussed previously
- **Better approach:** Use Present Perfect Passive (have/has been + past participle) for "from past to present changes"
- **Example:** "a reception center **has been constructed**" instead of "is constructed"

**3. "Runaway Long Sentences" Problem:**
- **Problem:** All "After" details crammed into one 70-word "monster sentence"
- **Solution:** Break down into multiple clear short sentences

## üí° How to Improve

### **Sentence Restructuring Example**

**Your long sentence:**
> On the other hand, in the After map, swimming area are made around the beach located on the leftest side of the map, next to a new constructed small village and footpath system to it's right. To the village's right, a reception center is constructed, surrounded by new vehicle track, under a new added restaurant, and above a new erected pier with some sailing boats.

**Restructured version:**
> In the "After" map, the island has been significantly developed. A swimming area has been designated on the western beach. Just east of this, a cluster of accommodation huts has been built, connected by a network of footpaths. In the center of the island, a reception building and a restaurant have been constructed. A vehicle track loops around these central facilities. Furthermore, a new pier for boats has been added on the southern coast.
