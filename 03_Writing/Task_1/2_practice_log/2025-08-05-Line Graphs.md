Line Graph

Thefts per thousand vehicles in four countries between 1990 and 1999.

The graph presents thefts per thousand vehicles in four countries from 1990 to 1999.


Overall, in this decade, the figure of theft in the UK continued to fluctuate, and then kept dropping till the end of 1999.While the figure showed  climbing trending in Sweden, and decreasing in both France and Canada.From 1990 to 1992, the number of vehicles theft rose slightly from around 17 to 20, then repeated this cycle again in the next 3 years in the UK, with the highest figure of vehicles theft among all 4 countries.Followed by Sweden, though experienced a marginal decrease in the begging of this decade, the figure continued to increase steadily to around 10, while France and Canada shared a similar pattern, dropped till 1993 then rose till 1995.The UK showed a major impact by presenting almost the same figure as the combination of all other countries in theses five years, while Canada with  minor impact  by holding merely approximately a quarter of the figure that the UK did.


In the second part on the decade, which is 1995 to 1999, we can see that the Uk experienced a steady decline, but still owned the largest figure 

 In all countries, accounted for around 37% , just slightly below 40% in 1999, the last year.Meanwhile, Sweden showed an overall increasing and reached approximately 14 at last, which is almost three times more than itself in 1990.France, on the other hand, continued to drop, and sendup with almost the same figure that Canada held in 1999, while Canada kept slowly growing, around 6 for both countries, which was just slightly above 10 % in total.

詳細分析

寫作任務回應 (Task Achievement) - Band 5

    優點 👍:

        你在總覽 (Overall) 段落中成功地總結了四個國家的主要趨勢。

        你選擇了用時間來分段，這是一個非常好的架構。

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        關鍵數據解讀錯誤：這是這篇文章最主要的問題，我們需要特別關注。

            對「值」和「百分比」的混淆：在描述英國時，你寫到 accounted for around 37%。這是一個根本性的錯誤。線圖的 Y 軸是「每千輛車的失竊數」(Thefts per 1,000 vehicles)，它是一個數值，而不是一個百分比。Account for X% (佔了 X%) 是用在餅圖或描述部分佔整體的比例時，不能用在這裡。你應該直接說「the figure for the UK was approximately 17」。

            比較錯誤：你提到瑞典最後的數字 approximately 14 是 1990 年的三倍 (three times more than itself in 1990)。但瑞典 1990 年的數字大約是 9，14 連兩倍都不到。

            總和計算錯誤：你提到英國的數字 almost the same figure as the combination of all other countries。以 1992 年為例，英國約為 20，而其他三國總和約為 9+8+6 = 23。兩者並不一樣。

        為何這很嚴重？ Task 1 的核心就是準確地描述和比較圖表中的數據。當數據解讀出現根本性錯誤時，會嚴重影響考官對你理解能力的評分，因此這一項的分數會被限制在 Band 5。

連貫與銜接 (Coherence and Cohesion) - Band 7

    優點 👍:

        你的文章架構非常好！「引言 → 總覽 → 前半段時期 → 後半段時期」的組織方式邏輯清晰，易於跟隨。這是你做得非常出色的一點。

詞彙與文法 (LR & GRA) - Band 6.0

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        拼寫與用詞錯誤：

            in the begging -> 應為 in the beginning。

            sendup with -> 應為 ended up with。

            climbing trending -> 語法不對，可以說 showed an upward trend。

            owned the largest figure -> 可以說 recorded / had the highest figure。

        「句子瘦身」仍需加強：你的句子結構依然有偏長且雜亂的問題，這違反了我們「優化長句結構」的計畫。

            你的長句：Followed by Sweden, though experienced a marginal decrease in the begging of this decade, the figure continued to increase steadily to around 10, while France and Canada shared a similar pattern, dropped till 1993 then rose till 1995.

            瘦身後可以這樣寫：Sweden's figure was the next highest. Although it experienced a marginal decrease at the beginning of the decade, it then increased steadily to around 10 by 1995. During the same period, France and Canada shared a similar pattern of an initial drop followed by a rise.

            這樣拆分後，每個句子的意思都更清晰，也避免了文法錯誤。

總結與學習重點：回到你的作戰計畫

這次的練習非常有價值，它暴露了你在「第一優先：杜絕致命性失誤」這個項目中的新挑戰——準確解讀不同圖表類型。

    首要任務：理解圖表

        下筆前，花 15 秒看清楚 Y 軸的單位是什麼？是數值、百分比、金額，還是其他東西？這決定了你全文的用詞。線圖通常描述的是「數值」的變化，而不是「百分比」的構成。

    持續執行計畫

        檢查數據：這次的錯誤再次證明了「30 秒極速檢查法」的重要性。

        句子瘦身：繼續練習將過長的句子拆解，確保清晰度和準確性。
