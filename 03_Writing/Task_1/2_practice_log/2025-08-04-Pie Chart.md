## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The charts present various sources of spending and revenging from an American based children's charity in 2016.

Overall, source types for revenue was more diverse, with 6 different types, and also include more percentage value ranges. While expenditures only held 3 types, and with less percentage value ranges.

We can see that donated food was accounted for most figure of revenue, 86.6%, which is approximately 6 times more than the combined portion of all other sources in revenue. Followed by community contributions, dramatically dropped to 10.4%, which is the only source exceeding 10% other than donated food in revenue. Then program revenue, another sharp decline, accounted for 2.2%, when others (other income, government grants, investment income), with a total share slightly below 1% (0.8%), and government grants, investment income occupied equal contribution on percentage of revenue (both 0.2%). While donated food being the absolute majority type, and community contributions were clearly the second large contribution source, other types of revenue were relatively minor and limited.

On the other hand, expenditures merely presented 3 types. Program services was the largest one without doubt, only 4.8% away from being all expenditures, accounted for 95.8%. Next, with a gigantic fall, fundraising was accounted for 2.6%. Then management and general constituted 1.6%. There were only 2 obvious percentage range for expenditures, range of program services and 1.6% to 2.6% (from other 2 types). While expenditure only held 3 types and 2 portion ranges, revenue got 6 types and 3 portion ranges, showing that the type of revenue was much more complicated than that in expenditure.
