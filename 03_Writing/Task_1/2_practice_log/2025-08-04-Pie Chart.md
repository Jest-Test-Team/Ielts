The charts present various sources of spending and revenging from an American based children’s charity in 2016.


Overall , source types for revenue was more diverse, with 6 different types, and also include more percentage value ranges.While expenditures only held 3 types, and with less  percentage value ranges.

We can see that donated food was accounted for most figure of revenue ,86.6%, which is approximately 6 times more than the combined portion of all other sources in revenue.Followed by community contributions, dramatically dropped to 10.4%, which is the only source exceeding 10% other than donated food in revenue.Then program revenue, another sharp decline, accounted for 2.2%, when others(other income, government grants, investment income), with a total share slightly below 1%(0.8%), and government grants, investment income occupied equal contribution on percentage of revenue(both 0.2%).While donated food being the absolute majority type, and community contributions were clearly the second large contribution source, other types of revenue were relatively minor and limited.


On the other hand, expenditures merely presented 3 types.Program services was the largest one without doubt, only 4.8% away from being all expenditures, accounted for 95.8%.Next, with a gigantic fall, fundraising was accounted for 2.6%.Then management and general constituted 1.6%.There were only 2 obvious percentage range for expenditures, range of program services and 1.6% to 2.6%(from other 2 types) . While expenditure only held 3 types and 2 portion ranges, revenue got 6 types and 3 portion ranges , showing that the type of revenue was much more complicated than that in expenditure.

詳細分析

寫作任務回應 (Task Achievement) - Band 8

    優點 👍:

        分析極其出色：你的分析能力非常強。你不僅點出了最主要和次要的項目，還計算出「捐贈食物」大約是「其他來源總和的六倍」，這是一個非常精彩的觀察點，能讓考官眼前一亮。

        總覽觀點獨到：你的總覽 (Overall) 段落沒有選擇「A是最大宗，B是最大宗」這種常見的寫法，而是比較了兩者「來源的多樣性」，這是一個非常有洞察力且完全正確的切入點。

連貫與銜接 (Coherence and Cohesion) - Band 8

    優點 👍:

        架構清晰完美：文章的四段式結構（引言、總覽、詳述收入、詳述支出）非常清晰，邏輯無懈可擊。讀者可以非常輕鬆地跟隨你的思路。

        段落發展完整：每個段落都有一個明確的主題，並且都得到了充分的發展。

詞彙資源 (Lexical Resource) - Band 6

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        關鍵字拼寫錯誤：這是一個比較嚴重的問題。你在第一句就把 revenue (收入) 誤拼成了 revenging (復仇)。像這種會完全改變句子意思的關鍵字拼寫錯誤，會對詞彙分數產生顯著的負面影響。

        用詞不夠正式：和上次一樣，你使用了 gigantic fall (巨大的下降) 這樣的詞。在學術寫作中，用 a substantial decrease 或 a very sharp drop 會更為正式和恰當。

        搭配詞(Collocation)問題：

            source types for revenue was more diverse：可以說 The sources of revenue were more diverse。

            occupied equal contribution：可以說 made an equal contribution。

文法廣度與準確性 (Grammatical Range and Accuracy) - Band 6.5

    優點 👍:

        句型多樣性極佳：你的句型變化非常豐富，運用了大量的複雜句和從屬子句，展現了你駕馭文法的能力。

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        重複的語法錯誤：文章中反覆出現一個語法錯誤，即 was accounted for。

            正確用法：應該用主動語態 accounted for。例如：Donated food **accounted for** 86.6%。

            區別：accounted for 本身就是一個動詞片語，意思是「佔了…比例」。除非你把比例當主詞，寫成被動語態 86.6% was accounted for by donated food，但這比較繞口。直接用主動語態最清晰。

        主詞動詞一致性：

            source types ... was -> source types ... **were** (主詞是複數的 types)。
