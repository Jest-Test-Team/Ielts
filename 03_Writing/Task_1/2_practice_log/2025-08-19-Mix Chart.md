___


Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

Write at least 150 words.


The charts  present the figures of males and females attending 4 different evening courses at an adult education institution, and the five age groups of these students in 2009.


In general, the numbers of women attending most evening classes were higher than that of men, except for sculpture class, and students over 40 years old is the major group that participated.


We can see that the number of women attending language classes was 40, twice as much as the number  of men, which was 20.

And the number of women attending drama classes was 20, also twice as much as the number of men, which was 10.

Then for painting class,  the number of women attending this class was 30, slightly over the number of men attending this class, which was 25.

While sculpture class, the number of women attending this class was 5, merely half of the number of men attending this class, which was 10.


Turing to the pie chart, it’s clearly that students over 40 years old is the major group that participated in these classes, which made up 68%.

Students aged exactly 50 years or older than that made up 42%, slightly over 8 times as much as the percentage of students and under 20, which was 5%.

And students aged between 40 to 49 made up 26%, which was marginally more than double the percentage of students aged between 20 to 29, which was 11%.

Finally, students aged between 30 to 39 made up 16%, slightly more over than the percentage of students aged between 20 to 29 by 5%, and 10% less than  the percentage of students aged between 40 to 49 .

詳細分析

任務完成度 & 連貫銜接 (TA & CC): Band 9.0

    優點 👍:

        數據 100% 準確：你文章中提到的每一個數字、每一個比較都與圖表完全相符。你已經完全進化成了「數據狙擊手」。

        比較能力頂尖：你使用的比較句型非常精準且高級。例如，「50 歲以上的人數 (42%) 是 20 歲以下 (5%) 的八倍多一點 (slightly over 8 times)」，「40-49 歲 (26%) 的人數是 20-29 歲 (11%) 的兩倍多一些 (marginally more than double)」。這些都是極佳的比較。

        結構完美：你再次使用了處理混合圖表的最佳結構：「引言 → 總覽 → 詳述長條圖 → 詳述圓餅圖」，邏輯無懈可擊。

文法廣度與準確性 (GRA): Band 8.0

    優點 👍:

        句子掌控自如：你繼續保持了簡潔、清晰的句子，讓你的文章易於閱讀，同時也避免了不必要的文法錯誤。

        「句子碎片」已被徹底消滅：我可以正式宣佈，你已經完全戰勝了這個頑固的敵人。你的文章中沒有任何不完整的句子。

詞彙資源 (LR): Band 6.5 (唯一可以再精進的地方)

你的文章已經非常出色，唯一可以讓你從 8.0 邁向 9.0 的，是一些詞彙上更細微的精準度問題。

    一個核心的精準度問題：「much」vs.「many」

        問題：你在文章中兩次使用了 twice as much as 來比較人數。

        文法規則：

            much 用於不可數名詞 (uncountable nouns)，例如：money, water, time, information。

            many 用於可數名詞 (countable nouns)，例如：people, students, cars, meals。

        更精準的寫法：

            你的寫法：...twice as much as the number of men...

            更精準的寫法：...**twice as many as** the men... 或 ...**double the number of** men...

        行動筆記：這是一個非常細微但重要的區別，將它加入你的筆記本，能讓你的語言表達更上一層樓。

    一些小的筆誤：

        Turing to... -> **Turning** to...

        it’s clearly that -> **it is clear** that
