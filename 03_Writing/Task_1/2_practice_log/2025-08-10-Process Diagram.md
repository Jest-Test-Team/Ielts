## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The diagram depicts the different process of transforming tea leaves into 5 types of tea.

Overall, most tea types need to experienced 2 process stage after wilting and before oven drying, except for white tea.

We can see that all tea types must let tea leaves grow, then be plucked, and wilted in the first 3 stages. Next, after wilting, tea leaves for making green tea will have to be steamed, then rolled. While leaves for Oolong Tea and Large Leaf Black Tea are rolled in the same stage as well, and leaves for Small Leaf Black Tea is crushed simultaneously. When rolling and crushing are done, leaves for Oolong Tea, Large Leaf Black Tea, and Small Leaf Black Tea will be fermented, with the fermentation degree for Oolong Tea is slight, the degree for Large Leaf Black Tea, and Small Leaf Black Tea is full.

Finally, the last stage is oven drying, all the tea leaves will have to be included in this process, including White Tea, which barely being proceed. Once this step is completed, we'll see a result of 5 different types of tea.

## üìä Assessment Results

### Overall Band Score: **7.0**

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Task Achievement** - Band 7.5

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Exceptional overview insight:** Your overview paragraph is brilliant! Accurately summarized "except for white tea, most teas have two processing steps between wilting and drying"
- **Accurate details:** Correctly described key differences between green, oolong, and black teas in "steaming, rolling, crushing, fermentation degree"

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**
- **Minor detail error:** Mentioned all tea types must be "wilted" but white tea skips this step

---

### **Coherence and Cohesion** - Band 7.0

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Good transitions:** Used Overall, Initially, Next, While, Finally effectively

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**
- **Uneven paragraph development:** Main paragraph actually only has one sentence, which is too long

---

### **Lexical Resource & Grammar** - 6.0 ~ 6.5

#### ‚úÖ **Huge Progress: You've Mastered "Passive Voice"!**
- **Congratulations!** You very successfully and appropriately used passive voice throughout (be plucked, be steamed, is crushed, will be fermented)

#### ‚ùå **Final Challenge: "Monster Sentence"**
- **Problem:** Despite mastering passive voice, you ignored our "sentence slimming" plan again
- **Your main paragraph second sentence:** 78-word super long sentence that almost single-handedly lowered your Cohesion, LR, and GRA scores

**Why is it so fatal?**
- **Hard to read:** All information tangled together, making it difficult for examiners to see your excellent analysis
- **Error-prone:** Longer sentences have higher chance of grammar errors (like subject-verb disagreement "leaves...is crushed")

**Third "slimming surgery" on your long sentence:**

**Your long sentence:**
> Next, after wilting, tea leaves for making green tea will have to be steamed, then rolled. While leaves for Oolong Tea and Large Leaf Black Tea are rolled in the same stage as well, and leaves for Small Leaf Black Tea is crushed simultaneously. When rolling and crushing are done, leaves for Oolong Tea, Large Leaf Black Tea, and Small Leaf Black Tea will be fermented, with the fermentation degree for Oolong Tea is slight, the degree for Large Leaf Black Tea, and Small Leaf Black Tea is full.

**"Slimmed down" version:**
> After wilting, the process diverges for different teas. Tea leaves for green tea are first steamed and then rolled. In contrast, leaves for Oolong and Large Leaf Black Tea are only rolled, while those for Small Leaf Black Tea are crushed instead. Following this, the leaves for the three latter types of tea are fermented. The fermentation is slight for Oolong Tea, but full for both Large and Small Leaf Black Tea.

## üìù **Summary & Recommendations**

**Your progress is phenomenal!** You've mastered:

- **Top-tier analysis ability (TA)**
- **Clear article structure (CC)**
- **Core grammar for process diagrams - passive voice (GRA)**

**Your next goal:** Conquer the "final fortress" - sentence control mastery!
