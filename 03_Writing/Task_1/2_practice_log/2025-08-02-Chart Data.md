## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The chart demonstrates the usage percentage of social media platform from Canadian Adults in 2023.

Overall, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram occupied the majority of the Canadian adults' social media platform usage percentage, individually. While the numbers in this criteria of TikTok, X(twitter), LinkedIn, were all holding a relatively minor influences.

We can see that YouTube presented almost 90%(88%) usage percentage, which is the largest amount among all these platforms, even 4-times more than the usage ratio of LinkedIn. Followed by Facebook, slightly less than YouTube, showing almost 80%(79%), was still a very gigantic usage rate. Then Instagram, with approximately one quarter less than Facebook, showed the usage amount more than half(55%), which was more than the combination of X(twitter) and LinkedIn. These three platforms obviously dominated social media platforms in Canadian adults' market.

On the other hand, TikTok just barely reached more than 40%(42%), less than half of YouTube. Then X (Twitter), exactly a quarter, no more than a third of Facebook. Last, LinkedIn, the one with lowest user rate, only got merely 21%, only a half of TikTok. While the total number of these three platforms with relatively low user usage was even lower than the ratio of YouTube, it's clear that they have minor impact on Canadian adults' digital social life.
