## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The bar chart illustrates the main reasons why students enroll in a specific university in 2021.

Overall, teaching quality, suitable courses, and the reputation of the university are main concerns. While distance between parental home and facilities' qualities are less considered.

There are 3 significant and noteworthy reasons among these reasons. Gooding teaching quality held the greatest amount of all the reasons, 45%. Following by suitable courses, almost 40%. Then the reputation of this university, slightly exceed 30%.

While the other reasons are all with relatively low ratio. Distance between parental home and the university only hold 15%. Finally, sports and social related facilities barely reaching 10%.

To summarize, distance and facilities is less than a quarter of that in teaching qualities, suitable courses, and the reputation of this university.

## üí° How to Improve

### **Example Rewrite of One Paragraph**

**Your original text:**
> There are 3 significant and noteworthy reasons among these reasons. Gooding teaching quality held the greatest amount of all the reasons, 45%. Following by suitable courses, almost 40%. Then the reputation of this university, slightly exceed 30%.

**Improved version:**
> Looking at the more significant factors, the quality of teaching was clearly the primary reason for students' decisions, cited by 45% of them. This was followed by the availability of suitable courses, which was the second most important factor at 38%. The university's reputation also played a crucial role, influencing nearly a third of the students (32%). Together, these three academic-related reasons were dominant.

### **Key Improvements:**
1. **Better sentence variety:** Combined short sentences into longer, more complex ones
2. **More precise vocabulary:** Used academic alternatives
3. **Clearer comparisons:** Added direct comparisons
4. **Better flow:** Used transition words effectively

3. **Check word count** after writing to ensure you meet the minimum requirement
