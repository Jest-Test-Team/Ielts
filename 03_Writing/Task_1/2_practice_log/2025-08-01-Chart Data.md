詳細分析

寫作任務回應 (Task Achievement) - Band 5

    優點 👍:

        你成功地寫出了引言 (introduction) 和一個清晰的總覽 (overview)，正確地指出了最重要的和最不重要的因素。

        你引用了圖表中的數據來支持你的描述。

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        字數不足：這是最主要的問題。文章要求至少 150 字，但你的文章大約只有 121 字。字數不足會直接導致這項評分很難超過 Band 5，因為這代表你沒有充分地發展你的論點。

        數據不精確：你提到設施的部分 barely reaching 10%，但實際數據是 8%。在 Task 1 中，準確地報告數據非常重要。

連貫與銜接 (Coherence and Cohesion) - Band 5

    優點 👍:

        文章的四段式結構（引言、總覽、詳述一、詳述二）是正確的，讓讀者可以跟上你的思路。

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        句子過於簡短：你的文章大多由非常簡短的句子組成，這讓文章讀起來有點斷斷續續，不夠流暢。例如：

            There are 3 significant and noteworthy reasons among these reasons. Gooding teaching quality held the greatest amount of all the reasons, 45%.

            這兩句可以合併成一句更流暢的句子：Among the reasons cited, good teaching quality was the most significant, accounting for 45% of students.

        段落發展不足：你的兩個主體段落都太短了，更像是筆記而非完整的段落。你需要擴充句子，加入更多的比較來豐富內容。

詞彙資源 (Lexical Resource) - Band 5

    優點 👍:

        你嘗試使用了一些同義詞，例如用 concerns 來替代 reasons。

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        用詞重複且不夠精確：

            reasons 這個字出現了太多次。

            描述百分比時，amount (數量) 不是最適合的詞，可以用 percentage 或 proportion。

            held the greatest amount 可以換成更學術的 accounted for the highest percentage 或 was the most popular reason。

        拼字與用字錯誤：

            Gooding teaching quality -> 應為 Good teaching quality。

            Following by -> 應為 Followed by。

            facilities’ qualities -> the quality of facilities 會更自然。

            barely reaching 10% -> at just 8%。

文法廣度與準確性 (Grammatical Range and Accuracy) - Band 5

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        句型單一：如前所述，文章缺乏複雜的句型變化。高分的 Task 1 需要使用到從屬子句 (e.g., using which, while) 來連接資訊。

        文法錯誤：

            主詞動詞一致性：distance and facilities is less -> distance and facilities **are** less (主詞是兩個東西)。

            最後一句的總結 To summarize, distance and facilities is less than a quarter of that in teaching qualities, suitable courses, and the reputation of this university. 句型結構比較混亂，且不太容易理解。

如何讓文章更好？(範例)

讓我們來試著改寫你的其中一段，看看可以如何擴充和改善：

你的原文：
There are 3 significant and noteworthy reasons among these reasons. Gooding teaching quality held the greatest amount of all the reasons, 45%.Following by suitable courses, almost  40%.Then the reputation of this university, slightly exceed 30%.

修改後的範例：
Looking at the more significant factors, the quality of teaching was clearly the primary reason for students' decisions, cited by 45% of them. This was followed by the availability of suitable courses, which was the second most important factor at 38%. The university's reputation also played a crucial role, influencing nearly a third of the students (32%). Together, these three academic-related reasons were dominant.

句子更豐富 (Sentence Variety)：我將你原本的短句合併、擴充，變成了更長、更複雜的句子。例如，我用了 which was cited by... 和 which influenced... 這樣的子句來連接資訊。

用詞更精準 (Vocabulary)：

    reasons -> motivations, factors, considerations

    show -> details, illustrates

    important -> influential, significant, crucial, critical

    45% of students said... -> cited by 45% of students, accounting for 45%

比較更明確 (Clearer Comparisons)：我在最後一句直接加入了一個比較 (less than one-fifth of the percentage for teaching quality)，這能有效地回應題目中 make comparisons where relevant 的要求。

結構更流暢 (Better Flow)：使用了 Overall, In contrast, Furthermore, On the other hand 這些轉折詞，讓段落之間的邏輯關係更清楚。

總結建議：
你的思路是對的，但需要大膽地擴寫句子，把你想表達的資訊用更完整、更多樣的句型包裝起來。下次練習時，專注於：

    合併短句，創造更長的複合句。

    替換常用字，使用更精確的學術詞彙。

    寫完後，檢查字數是否達標。
