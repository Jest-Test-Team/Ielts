# IELTS Writing Task 1: Acid Production Analysis

## üìä Task Description

**Time Limit:** 20 minutes  
**Word Count:** At least 150 words

### Question
**Line Graph:** Eating sweet foods produces acid in the mouth, which can cause tooth decay.

**Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.**

---

## üìà Chart Data

**Acid Production in Mouth from Sweet Foods**

*Data shows pH levels over time for different types of sweet foods*

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The graph gives information on the acid in mouth procedeed by eating sweet foods, which is able to cause tooth decay.

Overall, the figures of acid produced by all three types of sweet foods decreased and reached their bottom at the same time. Then all the figures all increased, while the PH level figure represents acid unlikely to decay was reached in separate time.

We can see that the figure of acid produced by all three types of sweet foods decreased sharply till 5 minutes, while cane sugar showed the most significant decline in PH level, almost 5. Then honey almost remained the same figure till 10 minutes, and grew sharply and break the threshold of PH level recovery chances, which was approximately 5.5, in around 13 minutes. While fruit sugar shared similar pattern in this figure, dropped till 5 minutes, then steadily climbed till reaching same threshold in 20 minutes.

After 20 minutes, honey had a marginally growth till reaching the peak of PH level, which was 7, and then remained the same figure. And fruit sugar experienced a relatively sharp increase until around 34 minutes, and reached the peak of PH level then remained. On the other hand, cane sugar was the latest to reach threshold of PH level recovery chances, reached in around half an hour, and also the latest to reached the peak of PH level, around 40 minutes.

### Overall Band Score: **7.0**

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Task Achievement** - Band 6.5

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Precise focus selection:** Successfully identified key features - all substances decrease then increase, but cross "tooth decay threshold" at different times
- **Sufficient comparisons:** Continuously compared which sugar decreases fastest, which recovers latest to safe levels

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**
- **Data calculation error:** Mentioned cane sugar acid dropped "almost 5" but actual drop was from pH 7 to ~3.5 = 3.5 drop

---

### **Coherence and Cohesion** - Band 8

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Clear structure:** "Introduction ‚Üí Overview ‚Üí Changes before 20 minutes ‚Üí Changes after 20 minutes" organization is excellent

---

### **Lexical Resource** - Band 6.0

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Good trend vocabulary:** Used decreased sharply, most significant decline, steadily climbed, marginally growth, sharp increase effectively

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**
- **New "habitual vocabulary errors":**
  - **Problem:** Repeatedly used "the figure of acid" or "the figure of PH level"
  - **Issue:** "Figure" usually refers to specific numbers or shapes, not scale levels
  - **Correction:** "the figure of acid" ‚Üí "the acid level" or "the pH level"
- **Other collocation errors:**
  - "procedeed" ‚Üí "produced" (spelling error)
  - "break the threshold" ‚Üí "cross the threshold"
  - "had a marginally growth" ‚Üí "grew marginally" or "saw marginal growth"

---

### **Grammatical Range and Accuracy** - Band 6.5

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- **Good sentence variety maintained** - this is your strength

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**
- **Sentence clarity:** "Sentence slimming" practice still applies
- **Verb form errors:**
  - "honey ... grew sharply and break..." ‚Üí "grew sharply and **broke**..."
  - "the latest to reached" ‚Üí "the latest to **reach**"

## üí° How to Improve

### **Key Focus Areas:**

1. **Data verification** - Continue "30-second rapid check method"
2. **Vocabulary precision** - Distinguish between "figure" and "level"
3. **Sentence optimization** - Break down overly complex sentences for clarity

---

## üìù **Summary & Recommendations**

**Congratulations!** Your 7.0 score is an important milestone, proving your abilities are stable at a high level.

**Your current state:** Like a top athlete making final adjustments. You don't need to learn new things, but systematically eliminate "habitual errors" that cost you points.

**Action Plan:**
1. **Update your "Error Notebook"** - Add today's figure/level confusion issue
2. **Stick to your "Battle Plan"** - Execute "30-second rapid check" and "sentence slimming" every time
