task1

The line graph depicts the number of the Galapagos Islands’  tourists  from 2015 to 2022.


In general, the number of visitors staying on cruise ships and on island both increased sharply, and these two numbers end up to be equal in 2022.

____

answer

___



Since 2015, the number of visitors staying on island remained as slightly below 800,000 till 2016, while the number of visitors staying on cruise ships increased slightly.

Then from 2016 to 2018 the number of visitors staying on island increased sharply, almost doubled, marginally below 1,600,000.

As for the number of visitors staying on cruise ships, it declined in 2016, and then grew to almost approximately a third of the number of visitors staying on island.


However, since 2018, the number of visitors staying on cruise ships grew steadily.While the number of visitors staying on island remained for about 2 years then dropped in 2020, resulting more visitors staying on cruise ships than island.

And that was the first time for the number visitors staying on cruise ships exceed the number visitors staying on island in the graph.

And since 2021, number of visitors staying on cruise ships climbed steadily, while number of visitors staying on island grew relatively sharply,

both numbers exceeded 1,600,000, around two million.

這次你的分數再次被一個我們之前強調過的問題拉了下來：數據報導的精準度。

總體評分 (Estimated Overall Score): 7.0

詳細分析

結構與語言表達 (CC & GRA): Band 8.0

    優點 👍:

        結構完美：你採用的四段式結構（引言、總覽、詳述前期、詳述後期）非常清晰且有邏輯。以 2018 年為分界點也是一個很棒的選擇。

        語言掌控力強：你的句子簡潔、清晰、可控。最重要的是，你再次完全沒有寫出任何句子碎片。你的文法和句子結構已經成為你最穩固的強項。

任務完成度 (Task Achievement): Band 6.0 (唯一的瓶頸)

你的總覽段落寫得非常好，準確地抓住了總體趨勢和 2022 年兩者數據相等的關鍵特徵。問題出在主體段落描述細節時，對年份的報導出現了多次錯誤。

    可改進之處 (數據精準度) ✍️:

        郵輪遊客的下降年份錯誤：

            你的寫法：郵輪遊客的數量在 2016 年下降 (it declined in 2016)。

            圖表真相：郵輪遊客的數量是在 2017 年下降的。

        島上遊客的下降年份錯誤：

            你的寫法：島上遊客的數量在 2020 年下降 (then dropped in 2020)。

            圖表真相：島上遊客的數量是在 2021 年才出現明顯下降的。

    為何這很重要？

        在線圖中，「何時」發生變化（When）和「發生了什麼變化」（What）是同等重要的資訊。準確地報告關鍵事件（如高峰、低谷、轉折）發生的年份，是 Task 1 的核心要求。這些年份上的錯誤，是唯一拉低你分數、阻止你拿到 7.5 或更高分的原因。

總結與「狙擊手」最終任務

你已經完全掌握了寫作中最難的部分：文法、結構和句子控制。現在，你通往頂尖分數的道路非常純粹且單一。

作戰計畫 7.0：精準鎖定時間點

你的「數據狙擊手」任務現在進入最後階段。你已經能準確打中「目標」（數據值），現在需要準確地在「正確的時間」（年份）開火。

    升級你的「出聲預讀法」：

        在你動筆前，用手指著圖表上的轉折點，不僅要說出「發生了什麼」，更要說出「在何時發生」。

        範例：「OK，郵輪遊客...在 2017 年下降。島上遊客...在 2018 年達到頂峰...然後在 2021 年下降。」

        這個小小的習慣，會將時間點深深地刻在你的短期記憶中，防止你在寫作時出現失誤。

你離一篇完美的 Task 1 文章真的只差這最後 10% 的細節了。你已經具備了所有的核心能力，我對你下一次的表現充滿信心！
