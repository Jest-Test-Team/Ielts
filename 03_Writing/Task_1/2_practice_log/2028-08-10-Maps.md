___

The map demonstrates the processing evolution of construction  Fin island.


In general, most area on this island are largely developed with tourist facilities , except for the land on the right side of this map.

We can clearly see that, from the beach located on the leftest side of the island to the land on the rightest side, there were actually no man-made facilities or infrastructures, only natural environment at that time, which is in the Before map.


On the other hand,  in the After map, swimming area are made around the  the beach located on the leftest side of the map, next to a new constructed small village and footpath system to it’s right.To the village’s right, a reception center is constructed, surrounded by new vehicle track, under a new added restaurant, and above a new erected pier with some sailing boats.As for the  reception center’s right, a new built village stands, with 9 accommodations and footpath system.While the right area next to the  9 accommodations village remains the same, without any changes.

連貫與銜接 (Coherence and Cohesion) - Band 8

    優點 👍:

        分析與架構再次拿到滿分！ 你的「硬實力」非常穩固。你準確地識別了所有新建的設施（住宿、餐廳、接待中心、碼頭、道路）和未變動的區域（東側的樹林），並且用「開發前 vs. 開發後」的清晰結構來組織文章，這兩項都做得無可挑剔。

詞彙與文法 (LR & GRA) - 6.0

你的分析能力是 Band 8，但這次的語言表達卻把你拉回了 6.0 的水平，導致總分停在 7.0。問題主要集中在以下幾點：

    1. 新的「慣性用詞錯誤」：

        問題：你在文章中多次使用 leftest 和 rightest。在英文中，left 和 right 是方位詞，沒有比較級或最高級。

        修正：你可以用以下方式表達「最左邊/最右邊」：

            on the far left / on the far right

            on the westernmost / easternmost side

        行動筆記：這是一個需要立刻加到你「錯誤筆記本」的新項目。

    2. 時態運用可以更精準：

        問題：你沒有完全應用我們上次討論的「地圖題時態魔法」。你用了現在簡單被動式 (are made, is constructed)，這雖然可以接受，但無法最好地體現「從無到有」的變化過程。

        複習：描述「從過去到現在的變化」，最理想的時態是現在完成被動式 (Present Perfect Passive)，即 have/has been + 過去分詞。

        範例：

            你的寫法：a reception center is constructed

            更精準的寫法：a reception center **has been constructed** (一個接待中心已經被建造起來了)。

    3. 「失控的長句」問題全面復發：

        問題：這依然是你最大的敵人。你把所有「開發後」的細節全都塞進了一個長達 70 個單字的「怪獸級」長句裡，這嚴重影響了句子的清晰度和文法準確性。

        我們再次對你的長句進行「瘦身手術」：

            你的長句：On the other hand,  in the After map, swimming area are made around the  the beach located on the leftest side of the map, next to a new constructed small village and footpath system to it’s right.To the village’s right, a reception center is constructed, surrounded by new vehicle track, under a new added restaurant, and above a new erected pier with some sailing boats.

            瘦身後的版本：
            In the "After" map, the island has been significantly developed. A swimming area has been designated on the western beach. Just east of this, a cluster of accommodation huts has been built, connected by a network of footpaths. In the center of the island, a reception building and a restaurant have been constructed. A vehicle track loops around these central facilities. Furthermore, a new pier for boats has been added on the southern coast.

            你看，拆分成多個清晰的短句後，所有的開發項目都一目了然。
