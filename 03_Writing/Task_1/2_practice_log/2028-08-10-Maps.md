## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The map demonstrates the processing evolution of construction Fin island.

In general, most area on this island are largely developed with tourist facilities, except for the land on the right side of this map.

We can clearly see that, from the beach located on the leftest side of the island to the land on the rightest side, there were actually no man-made facilities or infrastructures, only natural environment at that time, which is in the Before map.

On the other hand, in the After map, swimming area are made around the beach located on the leftest side of the map, next to a new constructed small village and footpath system to it's right. To the village's right, a reception center is constructed, surrounded by new vehicle track, under a new added restaurant, and above a new erected pier with some sailing boats. As for the reception center's right, a new built village stands, with 9 accommodations and footpath system. While the right area next to the 9 accommodations village remains the same, without any changes.

### **Lexical Resource & Grammar** - 6.0

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**

**1. New "Habitual Vocabulary Errors":**
- **Problem:** Used "leftest" and "rightest" multiple times. In English, left and right are directional words without comparative or superlative forms
- **Correction:** Use "on the far left/right" or "on the westernmost/easternmost side"
- **Action Note:** Add this to your "Error Notebook" immediately

**2. Tense Usage Could Be More Precise:**
- **Problem:** Didn't fully apply "Map Question Tense Magic" discussed previously
- **Better approach:** Use Present Perfect Passive (have/has been + past participle) for "from past to present changes"
- **Example:** "a reception center **has been constructed**" instead of "is constructed"

**3. "Runaway Long Sentences" Problem:**
- **Problem:** All "After" details crammed into one 70-word "monster sentence"
- **Solution:** Break down into multiple clear short sentences

## üí° How to Improve

### **Sentence Restructuring Example**

**Your long sentence:**
> On the other hand, in the After map, swimming area are made around the beach located on the leftest side of the map, next to a new constructed small village and footpath system to it's right. To the village's right, a reception center is constructed, surrounded by new vehicle track, under a new added restaurant, and above a new erected pier with some sailing boats.

**"Slimmed down" version:**
> In the "After" map, the island has been significantly developed. A swimming area has been designated on the western beach. Just east of this, a cluster of accommodation huts has been built, connected by a network of footpaths. In the center of the island, a reception building and a restaurant have been constructed. A vehicle track loops around these central facilities. Furthermore, a new pier for boats has been added on the southern coast.
