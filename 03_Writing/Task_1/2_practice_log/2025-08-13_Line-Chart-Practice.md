## üìà Chart Data

**Population Growth in Three Major Australian Cities (1992-2016)**

*Data shows annual population growth figures over 24 years*

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The line chart demonstrates growth of population in three major cities in Australia for 9 years, from 1992 to 2016.

Overall, population growth in all these 3 cities increased, but the population growth degree in Brisbane is much lower than others.

We can see that the population of Melbourne and Sydney dropped then sharply increased till around 1996 to 1997.

With the population of Melbourne merely below 40,000 people and the population of Sydney was approximately 50,000 people in around 1996 to 1997.

While the population of Brisbane increased steadily till 1995, then sharply decline til 1998.

And from about 1996, though began with declining, the population of Sydney increased till 2001, with just over 60,000 people in 2001.

Then the population of Melbourne remained around slightly below 50,000 in 2004.

And the population of Brisbane increased to marginally below the population of Melbourne in 2004.

While the population of Sydney dropped sharply from 2001 to 2004, with only slight above 20,000 population in 2004, less than half of the population in Melbourne or Brisbane.

And from 2004, the population of Sydney rocketed to slightly above 80,000, then drop sharply to slightly below 60,000, and sharply increased til 2016, with more than 100,000 people.

Population in Melbourne shared the similar pattern, rocketed to almost 100,000 around 2009, then drop sharply to approximately 75,000, and increased til 2016, even with more population than Sydney did.

Which both show major influences.

On the other hand, population in Brisbane kept fluctuating til 2016, with merely around 50,000 people in 2016.

Which shows minor influence.

## üìä Assessment Results

### Overall Band Score: **5.5**

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Critical Issue #1: Fundamental Misreading of Chart (Task Achievement - Band 5.0)**

This is the most fundamental reason for the low score.

#### **Problem 1: Misunderstanding Y-axis Meaning**

- **Your description:** Throughout the article, you used "the population of Melbourne (Melbourne's total population)..." 
- **Chart reality:** The Y-axis shows "(thousands)" - annual population growth, not total population
- **Correct understanding:** The chart doesn't say "Sydney's total population was 50,000 in 1996," but "Sydney's population increased by 50,000 in 1996"
- **Why fatal?** This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the chart's core information, making examiners think you don't understand the question

#### **Problem 2: Incorrect Information in Introduction**

- **Your writing:** "9 years, from 1992 to 2016"
- **Reality:** 1992 to 2016 is actually 24 years
- **Impact:** This basic factual error gives examiners a careless first impression

---

### **Critical Issue #2: "Monster Sentences" & Chaotic Structure (GRA & CC - Band 5.0 ~ 5.5)**

#### **Problem 1: Abandoned Short Sentence Strategy**

- **Issue:** You completely abandoned the "short sentence strategy" that we practiced multiple times and was very successful
- **Consequence:** This directly caused your grammar (GRA) score to drop, and made your article extremely difficult to read

#### **Problem 2: Chaotic Description Order**

- **Issue:** When describing 1996-2004, you jumped between Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane without following clear logic
- **Impact:** This severely affected your coherence (CC) score

#### **Problem 3: Habitual Language Errors**

- **Sentence fragments:** "Which shows minor influence" still exists
- **Awkward phrases:** "major/minor influences" doesn't make semantic sense here

## üí° **How to Get Back on Track: Emergency Battle Plan**

This practice is like a stress test, showing that when charts become more complex, our previously established good habits aren't stable enough. Don't worry, this is normal. We need to consolidate them again.

### **Step 1: Re-read "Chart ID Card" Notes**

Before your next practice, please re-read our notes about "Understanding Y-axis." Before writing, always ask yourself: "What exactly is this chart measuring? What is the unit?"

### **Step 2: Unconditionally Return to "Short Sentence Strategy"**

This is non-negotiable. In your next practice, please unconditionally and strictly follow the rule of "no more than 25 words per sentence." This is your lifeline for keeping articles clear and reducing errors.

### **Step 3: Choose One Clear Structure and Stick to It**

For multi-line charts, you have two choices:

| Option | Description | Structure |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **A) Time-based segmentation** | Describe changes for all cities from 1992-2004, then describe 2004-2016 | Period 1: All cities, Period 2: All cities |
| **B) Object-based segmentation** | Complete description of Melbourne's 24-year trend, then Sydney, finally Brisbane | City 1: Complete trend, City 2: Complete trend, City 3: Complete trend |

**Choose one and stick to it from beginning to end. Never mix different description objects in the middle of paragraphs.**

## üìù **Key Learning Points**

- **Chart comprehension is fundamental** - always understand what you're measuring
- **Short sentences are your lifeline** - don't abandon them under pressure
- **Structure consistency is crucial** - choose one approach and maintain it throughout

*Remember: This is a learning opportunity. You have the skills, now you need to apply them consistently under pressure.* üöÄ‚ú®
