**Time Limit:** 20 minutes  
**Word Count:** At least 150 words

## üìà Chart Data

**Steel Production and Demand in Britain (2010)**

*Data shows monthly production and demand figures over one year*

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Answer

The graphs demonstrate the production and demand for steel in Britain in 2010.

Overall, the amount of production of steel decreased largely at the end of this year, while the amount of actual demand fluctuated and end-up increasing.

We can see that in January, with the amount of production and actual demand being 4000, 2000, production's amount is twice than actual demand's amount.

Then both amounts increased marginally, though production's amount started earlier, and both slightly decreased til April.

From April, production's amount remained around the same number 4000 steadily, but experienced a slight decrease til August.

While in the same time period, the amount of actual demand kept fluctuated from first bottom slightly below 2000, to first peak almost 3000, then dropped back to around 2000. At this time, production's amount was merely above 3000, while the amount of actual demand was less than 70% of it.

From August, the amount of production, with a peak reaching 5000, then sharply decline to less than a thousand.

On the other hand, the amount of actual demand, also encountered a peak reaching approximately 2500, then sharply decline, but eventually increased in December.

And this increase caused the amount of demand exceed the amount of production in the end.

With the result of amount of demand, 2000, was two times more than the amount of production, just below 1000.

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### **Language Expression - Huge Progress (LR & GRA - Band 6.0 ~ 7.0)**

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**

**Clarity Revolution:** Short sentences have made your article unprecedentedly clear! Every piece of information is clean and crisp, completely eliminating the confusion and grammar errors caused by "monster sentences" in the past. Your GRA score has therefore made a qualitative leap.

**Error Rate Significantly Reduced:** Because sentence structures became simpler, grammar errors caused by complex structures almost disappeared.

#### ‚ùå **Areas for Improvement:**

**Word Collocation:** There's one habitual error that needs correction. When describing "steel production," you consistently use "production's amount." A more natural expression would be "the amount of production" or "production levels."

**Sentence Fragment:** Your last sentence "With the result of..." is incomplete. Sentences starting with "With" are usually phrases and cannot stand alone. You could change it to "The final result showed that the amount of demand..."

### **Task Achievement Challenge (Task Achievement - Band 6.0)**

Now that your language expression has become clear, we have the capacity to focus on the precision of analysis. This time, when describing trend details, you appeared to have some inaccuracies.

#### **Problem Analysis:**

**Inaccurate Trend Description:**
- You mentioned that production in January-February "increased marginally," but the chart shows it rose sharply from 4000 to nearly 5000, which is a very significant peak.
- Your overview says demand "end-up increasing," but actually, it went from 2000 at the beginning of the year to 2000 at the end, remaining the same.

**Timing Errors:**
- You mentioned that after August, production "with a peak reaching 5000," but the second peak on the chart occurred in September.

#### **Why This Matters?**

In Task 1, accurately describing the "beginning, development, turning point, and conclusion" of charts (when it starts, when it reaches peaks, when it turns, when it ends) is the key to getting high scores.

## üìù **Summary & New Battle Plan**

Today's practice is a milestone. You've proven that you have the ability to write clear, accurate sentences. This means we have successfully tamed the biggest enemy - "monster sentences."

Now, our battle plan has entered the next phase:

**Battle Plan 2.0: Precision Strike**

1. **Maintain Short Sentence Advantage:** Continue using concise, clear sentences. This is your newly established strong foundation.

2. **Focus on Data Details:** Before writing, point at the chart with your finger and softly say the key points: "Okay, production reached its highest point in February, around 5000. Then it reached its second peak in September, around 4900." This small action will force you to notice precise timing and values.

3. **Polish Language Details:** Add "production's amount ‚Üí the amount of production" to your "Error Notebook."

- **Data accuracy is crucial** - always verify your observations against the chart
- **Continue building on your success** - you've found a winning formula, now perfect it
