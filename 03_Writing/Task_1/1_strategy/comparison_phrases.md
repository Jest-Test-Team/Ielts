# IELTS Task 1: Precision Comparison Phrases üìä

## üéØ Essential Comparison Categories

### **1. Multiples and Fractions** üî¢

When data has clear multiple or fractional relationships, always point them out.

#### **Data Examples:**
- A = 60%, B = 30%, C = 10%

#### **Sample Sentences:**
- The figure for A (60%) was **twice as high as** the figure for B (30%).
- The proportion of A was **double** that of B.
- The percentage for B (30%) was **three times the figure for** C (10%).
- Conversely, the figure for C was only **a third of** the figure for B.
- The rate for B (30%) was **exactly half** the rate for A (60%).

---

### **2. Significant Gaps** ‚öñÔ∏è

Use when data has large gaps but not exact multiples.

#### **Data Examples:**
- Fast food meals = 115 times
- Sit-down meals = 60 times

#### **Sample Sentences:**
- The number of fast food meals (115) was **significantly higher than** that of sit-down meals (60).
- There was a **considerable gap** between the number of fast food meals and sit-down meals.
- The consumption of fast food was **substantially greater than** that of sit-down meals.
- The difference between the two categories **widened dramatically** after 1990.

---

### **3. Slight Gaps** üìè

Use when data is very close.

#### **Data Examples:**
- Men's poverty rate = 6%
- Women's poverty rate = 7%

#### **Sample Sentences:**
- The poverty rate for women (7%) was **marginally/slightly higher than** for men (6%).
- The figures for both genders were **almost the same**, with only a minimal difference of 1%.
- The poverty rate for men **closely followed** that of women.

---

### **4. Superlatives and Ranking** üèÜ

Used to describe extreme values and order in data.

#### **Data Examples:**
- Hiking = 80%, TV = 65%, Theatre = 45%

#### **Sample Sentences:**
- Hiking was by far **the most popular** activity, at 80%.
- The **least common** activity was going to the theatre, with a figure of 45%.
- The highest percentage was recorded for hiking, **followed by** watching TV at 65%.
- Watching TV **ranked second**, while going to the theatre was the least popular of the three.

---

### **5. Approximation** üîç

Use when chart data isn't exact integers, showing language flexibility.

#### **Data Examples:** 98,000 people

#### **Sample Sentences:**
- The figure peaked at **approximately/roughly/around** 100,000.
- The number of people reached **just under** 100,000.
- The population growth was **just over** 60,000.

## üéØ **"Near Multiple" Precision Comparison Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Slightly Less than a Multiple**

#### **Data Examples:**
- A = 58, B = 20 (A is very close to being 3 times B)

#### **Sample Sentences:**
- The figure for A (58) was **almost three times as high as** the figure for B (20).
- At 58, the value of A was **nearly three times** that of B.
- The number of A was **approximately triple** the number of B.
- The figure for A was **just short of being three times** the figure for B. *(This is more advanced and idiomatic)*

---

### **Scenario 2: Slightly More than a Multiple**

#### **Data Examples:**
- A = 43, B = 20 (A is a bit more than double B)

#### **Sample Sentences:**
- The figure for A (43) was **just over twice as high as** the figure for B (20).
- At 43, the value of A was **slightly more than double** that of B.
- The number of A was **a little more than twice** the number of B.

---

### **Scenario 3: Approaching Fractions**

#### **Data Examples:**
- A = 26, B = 50 (A is very close to half of B)

#### **Sample Sentences:**
- The number for A (26) was **almost half** the number for B (50).
- At 26, the figure for A was **roughly half** that of B.
- The proportion of A (26%) was **approximately a quarter of** the proportion of C (99%).

## üèõÔ∏è **Topic: Culture & Society** (e.g., Museums, Local Tourism)

### **Causes: Why Locals Don't Visit Local Sites**

| Argument | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Proximity & Familiarity breeds indifference** | Taipei residents are less likely to visit the Taipei Fine Arts Museum because it is always available to them. |
| **Over-Commercialization deters locals** | The museum's gift shops sell generic crafts, which offer no unique experience for citizens who can buy them elsewhere. |

### **Solutions: How to Attract Local Visitors**

| Solution | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Host unique, non-commercial events** | A public interview with a famous local film director (Wei Te-Sheng) about local history was a huge success, attracting thousands. |

---

## üíº **Topic: Work & Lifestyle** (e.g., Work-Life Balance)

### **Problems: How Digitalization Blurs Boundaries**

| Argument | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Remote work can lead to longer, unmonitored hours** | Software developers working from home face pressure to meet performance metrics that require long-running automated tasks, extending their workday. |
| **Personal communication apps are co-opted for work** | Companies forcing employees into Line groups for work discussions, leading to stressful notifications after hours. |

### **Solutions: How to Re-establish Boundaries**

| Solution | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Use technology to fight technology** | Use dedicated work apps (Slack, Discord) and combine them with the phone's built-in "do-not-disturb" or scheduled notification features to silence work alerts during personal time. |

---

## üéì **Topic: Education & Society** (e.g., Purpose of Schools)

### **Argument: Against a Purely Vocational Focus**

| Argument | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **An over-emphasis on creating "good workers" can stifle innovation** | Traditional, rigid computer science curricula (e.g., SQL databases) produce competent engineers but may lack the cross-disciplinary environment needed for breakthroughs like ChatGPT. |
| **School is for individual discovery, not just career training** | Guitarist Kiko Loureiro studied both music and biology in high school, allowing him to make an informed life choice based on his individual passion rather than just a career path, eventually winning a Grammy. |
