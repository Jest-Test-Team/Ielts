| Priority | Error Type | ‚ùå My Common Mistake (Example) | ‚úÖ The Fix / Better Version | üß† Mental Rule / Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Grammar** | **Sentence Fragments** | `Which may result in...` <br> `Showing major influence...` | `..., which may result in...` <br> `..., showing major influence...`<br><br>**Rule:** `Which` and `-ing` clauses are "hooks," not "engines." They must be attached to the previous sentence with a comma. |
| **2** | **Grammar** | **Run-on / "Monster" Sentences** | (Multiple examples of sentences over 40-50 words that combine too many ideas) | Break the idea into 2-3 shorter, clearer sentences. | **Rule:** The **"25-Word Max Iron Law."** This is the #1 way to improve clarity and reduce errors. |
| **3** | **Vocabulary** | **Keyword Spelling & Factual Errors** | `Cooper` -> `Copper` <br> `govenment` -> `government` <br> `Dorothy` the sheep -> `Dolly` | Proofread the final text against the prompt. Double-check famous names/facts. | **Rule:** Careless errors in keywords and famous examples undermine credibility. Add this to your 30-second final check. |
| **4** | **Vocabulary** | **Imprecise Word Choice** | `colleges` vs `colleagues` <br> `fell` vs `feel` <br> `loss` vs `lose` | Use the correct word based on meaning. | **Rule:** These are personal "fossilized errors." Review this list before every practice to stay vigilant. |
| **5** | **Structure** | **Incorrect Task 2 Structure** | Writing a separate "Overall" paragraph after the introduction. | The thesis/outline is the **final part of the introduction**. | **Rule:** Task 2 is a strict **four-paragraph** essay (Intro, Body 1, Body 2, Conclusion). |

## üîß Passive Voice Formula

**Passive Voice Form:** be verb + past participle (p.p.)

**Your Common Errors:**
- `...and being sent to...` ‚Üí `...and **are sent** to...` (are + past participle sent)
- `...bricks will be shift to...` ‚Üí `...bricks will be **shifted** to...` (be + past participle shifted)

**Action Note:** Write this formula in your "Error Notebook" and record these examples.
