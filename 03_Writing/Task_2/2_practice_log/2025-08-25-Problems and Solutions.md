question:

Many museums and historic sites are mainly visited by tourists rather than by local residents nowadays. What are the causes of this? What can be done for museums and historic sites to attract more local visitors?


answer:

Recently, the major visitors of museums and historic sites are now visited more by tourists instead of  the locals.

In this essay, I’ll explore the causing factors of this trend, and then propose my solution to address them.

Firstly, I would like to give examples and details toward these issues and secondly present my actual solving methods.


Overall, modern people seemed to be more interested in others’ cultural and historical heritages, which may lead to noteworthy increasing numbers of tourists for related sites.

On the other hand, obvious decreasing amount of local citizens paying visit to  these locations.


It can be argued that humans are creature that could be more curious about others’ possessions, whether physical or in other formats.

Thus it’s not surprising that most people pay lots of attention to historical related sites and museums located outside their range of routine lifes.

Furthermore, some may even argued that these spots have been commercialized by the force of capitalism and governments, causing less attraction to locals.

Using Taipei Art Museum for example, residents lived in Taipei usually don’t pay visits to it, since it’s close to them hence losing the feeling of excitement.

Also, worth mentioning, Taipei Fine Art Museum gradually developed with more gift shops and attached season-limited markets, which are supported by Taipei government and sponsored by firms.

These activities and units sell common crafts can be seen around in Taipei, which can be attractive to tourists, but could be useless for citizens there.


In order to solve this issue, it could be helpful to focusing on holding creative and fresh activities and cut off some commercial units in museums and historic sites.

For instance, using Taipei Art Museum still, there used to be some occasional events attract locals more.

One would be the public-facing interview session with a famous movie director, Wei-De Sheng, who directed a film about Taipei back to the period colonized by Japan.

And the interview was without any commercial elements, but still a huge success with thousands of people, almost exceeded the maximum capacity of Taipei Art Museum.

Many citizens were truly satisfied by the freshness and off-selling of this event and hope to have more similar ones held.


To sum up, lack of freshness for being around and too many selling products may caused local residents loss motivations to visit these locations.

On the contrary, tourists will have more motivations for being unfamiliar with the sites or areas.

To solve these issues, frequently holding constructive and fleshing events without merchandise-selling purposes could help.

For locals can gain excitements and feel less for being forced to purchase crafts around museums and historic sites.
