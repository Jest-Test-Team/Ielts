## ‚úçÔ∏è **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
It is often argued that science brings tremendous merits to society, hence supporting students studying or researching in related fields should be more.

This essay will explore why supporting or funding science students is vital, which I agree on.

Firstly, I will discuss some benefits that science has contributed to us by students pioneers and secondly the importance of students' creativity as well as innovation.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Scientific Contributions & Innovation**
Science has brought lots of merits to us, like modern vehicle, wireless communications, and AIoT (Artificial Intelligence based Internet of everything), by which make our world more convenient and safer.

Meanwhile, lots of these marvelous creations are created in school labs, like ChatGPT was born in California University of Technology.

Hence, the incredible works are usually come from some college students' project.

**Example:** For example, Nuxt3, an extremely popular open-source website development frontend framework, was created by a group of college students in Chin Hua University.

Now Nuxt3 is one of the website frontend framework around the world, furthermore, without paying even a penny, anyone can build their own websites using this reliable, steady production.

However, the creators of NUXT3, being open-source service pioneers, encountered finance related obstacles, thus they started to ask for donation about 5 years ago.

However, nuxt3 was bought by company called Vercel, during this May, with no promise to stay free-of-charge to use.

And in this case, if supporting for the students gave birth to Nuxt3 was more active, maybe they can continue to operate and release more free magical products instead of being merged into a big cooperation.

### **Body Paragraph 2: Student Creativity & Innovation**
Besides finance factors, innovation is another important aspect to be examined.

Students are usually are more creative than full time workers, hence ideas or plans are usually more innovative.

Furthermore, professors sometimes asked their students about thought regarding their research to gain fresh ideas, like Oppenheimer did.

**Example:** Take Taiwanese students majored in chemistry for instance, their graduation project can range from auto-skin-wound healing sprays, new type rocket fuels, to even anti materials involving quantum entanglement theories.

Those projects showed creativities barely can be found on full time workers, and is indeed, very impressing and possible to change the world.

However, without further support, these treasure of knowledge and concepts, will usually sealed, archived, and stored inside of a big warehouse.

Without supporting science students and their incredible works, their creativities will decreased extremely fast, after their graduation and start full-time jobs, which is such a shame.

### **Conclusion**
To sum up, I agree that science students should get more support, for students can be pioneers leading world toward a relatively better direction.

And if without enough support, science students will not be able to contain their inspiring works, but turnout to be another ordinary full-time labor.

From my point of view, it is vital for whether governments, schools, cooperations, or even ordinary individuals, to support science students.

Because no matter what kind of supports are provided, it will be a boost to enhance our world via the hand of these science students.
