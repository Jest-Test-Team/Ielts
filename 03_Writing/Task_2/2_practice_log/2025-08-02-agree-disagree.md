## ✍️ **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
Over the past 50 years, women have succeeded in attaining positions comparable to those of men. However, many people argue that this progress is still insufficient and that true gender equality has yet to be achieved. I totally agree with this view because patriarchal culture remains deeply rooted, and there is a lack of legal protections and policies.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Patriarchal Culture & Social Perceptions**
First and foremost, the realisation of gender equality is hindered by long-standing societal perceptions of women that have existed for centuries. The social system in many cultures places men in a superior position and women in a subordinate one, a hierarchy that remains strong today. This is evident in social norms, gender roles, and the unequal division of labour. For example, many job vacancies list male applicants as the preferred candidates, despite women having similar skills and levels of education. As a result, women often find it more difficult to secure employment.

### **Body Paragraph 2: Weak Legal Frameworks & Enforcement**
Furthermore, laws frameworks designed to safeguard women's rights are frequently weak and poorly enforced. In many countries, laws exist on paper but are not implemented effectively, allowing perpetrators to escape punishment and discouraging victims from speaking out. Consequently, women remain vulnerable to violence, harassment, and discrimination across multiple areas, including workplaces and domestic settings. For example, in Indonesia, 20% of female employees report experiencing workplace harassment without receiving justice due to slow legal processes and lack of support services. This indicates that genuine gender equality remains far from being achieved.

### **Conclusion**
In conclusion, although women have made significant progress over the past five decades, genuine gender equality has yet to be fully realised. This is mainly because of enduring patriarchal norms and inadequate legal safeguards, which require urgent action from both policymakers and society.
