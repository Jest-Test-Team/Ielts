## ‚úçÔ∏è **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
Animals being used in medical research are thought to be treated unfairly for some people, though others view it as justifiable.

In this essay, I will discuss both sides, and give my opinion upon them.

Firstly, I will explore the essential needs for lab animals of human and secondly I will discuss the unethical aspect of it.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Arguments Supporting Animal Testing**
It is true that human, in a certain degree, rely on animals to conduct medical related experiments, since we have restricted laws on human body experiments, which is established widely by almost all governments.

And to achieve medical goals, scientists' best alternatives are animals, with less limitations of laws, and also with lower cost.

**Example:** For instance, eye drops, with widely requirements globally, is an extremely popular and needed medical product.

First being tested on rabbits, for human eyes are very sensitive and vulnerable.

And by experimenting on rabbits' eyes instead of human's, we save ourselves from producing blinds, and create thousands of magical eye drops to ease our soar eyes.

Hence benefit ourselves, meanwhile, avoid law penalties and negative impact on human bodies.

### **Body Paragraph 2: Arguments Against Animal Testing**
However, the regulation, guidelines, and responded penalties for animal experiments are not set as clear, concise, and careful as human body experiments are.

Moreover, experiments on animal are usually conducted for the fist time ranged from drugs, surgery types, even to gene transformation, which is with tremendous risk, and can possible harm animals badly.

**Example:** For example, the first clone experiment used a sheep, named Dorothy, and after several experiments, there were two Dorothy.

The second Dorothy had a short life, with multiple physical body vulnerabilities, and passed away with pain.

This series of cloning actions brings out unethical dark side of animal experiments.

While seeking for greatest benefit of human beings, we simultaneously view ourselves as more superior than all other creatures.

Which may result in making us more arrogant, and furthermore, ignoring importance and necessity of other style of lives then eventually become the tyrant of our world.

### **Conclusion**
To sum up, it's a fact that animal experiments are necessary for human beings in some degree, however, there are also unethical aspects and concerns in them.

From my aspect, these experiments must be regulated, conducted, planned properly, so that harm to animals can be minimized at the most degree.
