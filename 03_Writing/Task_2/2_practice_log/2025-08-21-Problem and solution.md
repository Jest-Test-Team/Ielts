## ✍️ **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
Implementing physical exercises regularly is vital for individuals to remain healthy.

In this essay, I will explore several reasons explaining why doing enough physical exercises regularly is important, and methods to ensure people keep this as a habit.

Firstly, I will discuss reasons and factors on importance of doing enough regular physical exercises.

And secondly I will give my advice on ensuring enough regular physical exercises are done for individuals.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Why Exercise is Important**
It is argued that muscles should be trained, or at least used, regularly to keep them growing, being strong, and being elastic, which are considered to be healthy.

Furthermore, it has been proven by neural scientists that regular physical exercises can stimulate our brain, which may keep our mind sharp and more possible to be stable.

**Example:** For instance, NBA players, with lots of physical training, can recovered much faster than ordinary people.

Take the player once in Thunder team, Paul George for example, who once broke his leg tragically, had recovered from the severe injury with merely half a year.

While the same damage would take people without taking those physical training more than 5 years to fully recovered, according to Paul's personal trainer and doctor.

Another example would be some of my colleges, whose jobs are software developers.

Cited by their words, it is very refreshing to jog in the morning for about an hour at 6:00 am, then workout for about 45 minutes before going to work.

They fell extremely energetic after doing these exercises, and be more able to focus on writing codes after that.

Hence it could be concluded that regular exercises can boost one's abilities both physically and mentally.

And should be considered as being very vital for maintaining good health.

### **Body Paragraph 2: Methods to Ensure Enough Exercise**
As for methods ensuring individuals getting enough exercise, from my point of view, there is an efficient way to achieve that.

First will be setting practical goals with well designed phases.

**Example:** For instance, it would be more achievable for individuals have never jog to start with a short jogging distance at first phase, like 2 kilometers a day.

Once individuals are used to this exercise habit, two more kilometers can be added to schedule then.

And if individuals feel uncomfortable with the new distance, then reduce some marginally till they fell confident to achieve this every day goal.

As a result, when individuals feel natural with this process, they will exercise almost like automatically.

Which is an evidence that their exercise habit was established without acknowledging on purpose.

### **Conclusion**
To sum up, regular physical exercise is important being healthy, for both mentally and physically.

And to achieve and contain this act with benefits, well planned schedules with roll back mechanism and well structured phases are highly recommended.
