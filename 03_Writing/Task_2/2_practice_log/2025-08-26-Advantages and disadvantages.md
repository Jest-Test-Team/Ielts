Some may argue that city areas are more suitable for living, while others recognize rural areas are instead. 

In this essay , I will explore advantages and disadvantages of living in cites to living in countrysides, as well as real-world examples for supporting my narratives.

Firstly, I‚Äôll discuss the pros and depict related instances of living in cities and secondly the cons as well as related examples of this topic.


Living in cities can be extremely convenient for labors required to transport between their home and workplace.

What‚Äôs more, convenience of living in these areas can be expanded to more reachable medical resources as well.

Take my home city, Taipei, for example, almost all job opportunities in my home country, Taiwan, are limited to a specific district in this city.

The district is Shin-Yi district, where Taipei 101 sits, and also where most well organized and firms with large scales choose to locate.

What‚Äôs more, there‚Äôs public traffic infrastructure constructed specifically for this area, metro public transportation system that, m.r.t for short.

Thus, for labors in Taiwan, it has become necessary to live in Taipei or areas around it for saving transportation time for working , which usually heading to Shin-Yi district using the m.r.t .

And hospitals as well as various kinds of clinics are also located in Taipei the most in Taiwan.

So, it would be more convent for citizens of Taipei to get medical resources , usually within an hour, comparing to those living in countrysides, which can take them up to almost a full day to reach nearest hospital.


On the other hand, all kinds of pollution in cities can be in extremely severe degree.

Air pollution made by factories and traditional vehicles will damage citizens‚Äô physical health conditions, and night-time noise pollution can harm citizens‚Äô mental health conditions.

Using Taipei, still, it can be hard to breathe sometime if there‚Äôs no wind blowing, for so many cars and motorcycles are running on roads as well as nearby factories are operating.

And when it comes to night, night club in Shin-Yi district can produce loud noise that cannot be ignored.

By which can be truly bothering to nearby residents for the noise would destroy their rests and sleeps.


To sum up, it‚Äôs convenient to live in cities for transportation factor both for working and medical issues.

But at the same time, pollution, like air and noise related ones, can be both physically and mentally damaging.

## Detailed Analysis

Task Response: Band 6.0 (The Main Weakness)

    The Problem: The prompt asks you to "Compare the advantages and disadvantages of living in the city to living in the countryside." This requires a balanced discussion of both locations.

    Your Essay: Your essay almost exclusively discusses the pros (convenience, jobs, medical care) and cons (pollution) of living in the city. You have not discussed the advantages of the countryside (e.g., cleaner air, less stress, lower cost of living, closer communities) or its disadvantages (e.g., fewer jobs, limited services).

    The Impact: Because you only focused on one half of the comparison, you have not fully addressed the question. This is a significant Task Response issue that limits your score.

A Better Structure for This Prompt:

A higher-scoring structure that directly compares both would be:

    Introduction

    Body Paragraph 1: The Case for the City. Discuss the advantages of the city (e.g., convenience, jobs) and contrast them with the corresponding disadvantages of the countryside (e.g., isolation, fewer opportunities).

    Body Paragraph 2: The Case for the Countryside. Discuss the advantages of the countryside (e.g., clean environment, peace) and contrast them with the corresponding disadvantages of the city (e.g., pollution, stress).
