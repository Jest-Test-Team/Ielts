## ✍️ **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
It is considered that the main functions and purposes of schools are transforming students into future good citizens and workers, not helping them grow as individuals, which I strongly disagree with.

In this essay, I'll demonstrate two major reasons proving goals of school should not only focus on vocational and citizenship related education, to explain my disagreement in more details.

Firstly, I'll explore the first reason for my disagreement and secondly my next and last reason for stating my point of view.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Innovation vs. Rigid Curriculum**
While vocational and citizenship related education are indeed important, there might many fixed, ancient, even outdated rules, guidelines, procedures in these courses, which may educate students nothing but follow the rules on manuals, produced by industries, or policies, generated by governments, by which could eliminate innovations.

While innovations, some people may argued, are highly required in societies nowadays, for creating edge-cutting concept or product, and may benefit all individuals all around the word.

**Example:** For instance, Chat-gpt, the most popular and most innovative Artificial Intelligence based product, was created by OpenAI Lab, whose members were almost graduated from computer science or math related departments.

While these departments, back to around 2010s, still used fixed, and possible outdated, directions or guidelines as their course contents, such as SQLDB (search-query-language-database) management, on-premise host design, asymmetric encryption development, and linear, exponential variables calculation.

Though these contents may be helpful for students to become a brilliant worker, a traditional software engineer in this case, but these contents were lack of space for students to collide with other concept or peers from other background, hence loosing the ability to think, act, or respond with innovations. Fortunately, OpenAI's members met each other, and collide a lot, so we can use this magnificent product today.

### **Body Paragraph 2: Individual Exploration vs. Career Focus**
And in another point of view, not all subjects taught at school will be children's career choices eventually. By teaching various and comprehensive subjects, like math, science, sports, music and arts, languages, and much more, from my aspect, is actually an opportunity to let students to explore the world and become the individual they want to be, rather than explore their career and become the workers or citizens they want to be.

**Example:** For example, Kiko Lourio, a famous guitarist from Brazil, had confirmed that he was interested in music and medical industry when he was 18 years old, since music and biology are two of his favorite subjects in his high school time.

And he chose to play guitar and produce albums instead of went to medical school to be a doctor, and in 2016 he won a Grammy award.

Also, not log ago, he revealed the reason, he would like to stand on the stage and shredding, while enjoying the vibe and emotions from audiences and venues, rather than stay at emergency room doing surgery, which may stress him out. In this example, we can see schools can benefitting students as individuals and with successful result.

### **Conclusion**
To sum up, making children into responsible citizens and good workers are important topics for school, but individual development and enhancement are also important, by innovation developing and life exploring.

In my opinion, the main goal of schools should not be making children into good citizens and good workers, but to provide more options for students to experience, explore, and do experiments, while vocational and citizenship related contents included.

As a result, they will likely to have a more colorful individual growing progress, hence bring more benefits to our society.

- ✅ **Well-Developed Ideas:** Your two main arguments—that a focus on "good workers" can stifle innovation and that schools should facilitate individual exploration—are sophisticated and highly relevant
- ✅ **Excellent Examples:** Your use of ChatGPT and Kiko Loureiro as examples is brilliant. They are specific, modern, and perfectly illustrate your points

---

### **Coherence and Cohesion: Band 8.0** 🔗

Your essay's structure is flawless.

#### **Strengths:**
- ✅ **Logical Progression:** The four-paragraph structure is perfectly executed. The introduction sets a clear roadmap, each body paragraph develops a single distinct idea, and the conclusion effectively summarizes your argument
- ✅ **Clear Paragraphing:** Each paragraph has a clear central topic, making your argument very easy to follow

---

### **Lexical Resource (Vocabulary): Band 7.5** 💬

You demonstrated a wide and impressive range of vocabulary.

#### **Strengths:**
- ✅ You used sophisticated and precise terms like `vocational`, `citizenship`, `eliminate innovations`, `comprehensive subjects`, and `enhancement`
- ✅ The use of idiomatic language like "shredding" for guitar playing also shows a broad vocabulary

#### **Minor Errors:**
- ❌ `edge-cutting` instead of `cutting-edge`
- ❌ `loosing` instead of `losing`
- ❌ `instead of went` instead of `instead of going`

### **Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 6.0** ⚠️

This is the one area holding your essay back. Your essay is like a high-performance racing car with an incredibly powerful engine (your ideas) and a perfect chassis (your structure). But the steering is loose (your sentence control), so it keeps veering off the track.

#### **The Problem:**
- ❌ You have completely abandoned the "short sentence discipline" that you mastered in your Task 1 practice
- ❌ Your essay is filled with extremely long, complex sentences that are very difficult to control, leading to major structural errors

#### **Specific Errors:**
- **Run-on Sentences:** Your first body paragraph contains massive run-on sentences that connect too many ideas without proper punctuation or conjunctions
- **Sentence Fragments:** You have recurring sentence fragments, such as `While innovations, some people may argued...` This is a grammatically incomplete idea

## 🚀 **The Path to 8.0 and Beyond: Your Action Plan**

You have mastered the most difficult parts of Task 2: generating great ideas and organizing them logically. The final step is to present those ideas with the grammatical precision they deserve.

### **The Solution:**
Re-apply the "sentence diet" discipline to your Task 2 writing.

### **Sentence Surgery Example:**

#### **Your Original (Problem):**
> "While vocational and citizenship related education are indeed important, there might many fixed, ancient, even outdated rules, guidelines, procedures in these courses, which may educate students nothing but follow the rules on manuals, produced by industries, or policies, generated by governments, by which could eliminate innovations."

#### **"Diet" Version (Solution):**
> "While vocational and citizenship education are indeed important, these courses often contain fixed and outdated rules. Students may learn nothing but to follow manuals produced by industries or policies generated by governments. This approach could eliminate innovation."

**See how breaking your brilliant, complex idea into a series of shorter, clearer sentences makes it more powerful and completely eliminates the grammatical errors?**
