## IELTS Task 2 Practice Log: Work-Life Balance

###  - Date: August 26, 2025
###  - Topic: Many people find it hard to balance their work with other parts of their lives. What problems does this cause? How can this problem be overcome?
###  - Essay Type: Problem and Solution

# Lesson of the day - "one" actual example for "one" paragraph only.

## Version 1: Initial Draft & Analysis

Initial Score: 6.5

This first draft contained excellent, well-supported ideas but was severely limited by two major structural issues.
Category	Score	Strengths	Weaknesses & Action Plan
Task Response	8.0	- Fully answered both questions.<br>- Excellent, specific examples (remote developers, Line app).	- Ideas were strong but presented in a confusing manner.
Coherence & Cohesion	5.0	- Used linking words.	- Fatal Flaw: The entire body was a single, giant paragraph, mixing problems and solutions.<br>- Action: Adopt a clear, four-paragraph structure.
Lexical Resource	7.0	- Sophisticated vocabulary (digitalization, ambiguous, elegant solution).	- Some minor slips (strongly struggling -> a significant struggle).
Grammatical Range & Accuracy	5.5	- Attempted complex sentences.	- Major Flaw: "Monster sentences" were uncontrolled and hard to read.<br>- A recurring sentence fragment (Resulting...) was present.<br>- Action: Strictly enforce the "25-Word Max" sentence rule.

Key Takeaway from Version 1: The ideas and vocabulary were at a Band 7.0-8.0 level, but the lack of paragraphing and sentence control ("the packaging") capped the score at 6.5.

## Version 2: Revised Draft & Analysis

Revised Score: 7.0

This revised version implemented the key structural feedback, resulting in a significant improvement in Coherence and Cohesion. The user focused on developing one problem and one solution in more detail.
Category	Score	Strengths	Weaknesses & Action Plan
Task Response	7.5	- Ideas remained excellent and focused.	- The argument became narrower (one problem/solution). While valid, a broader approach might be needed for some prompts.
Coherence & Cohesion	7.5	- Massive Improvement: The new four-paragraph structure is clear and logical.	- The internal paragraph flow is still impacted by sentence structure.
Lexical Resource	7.0	- Vocabulary remained a key strength.	- Minor errors from the first draft were not edited.
Grammatical Range & Accuracy	5.5	- Range is good.	- No Improvement: The "monster sentences" and the sentence fragment within the paragraphs were not addressed.

Key Takeaway from Version 2: Fixing the "macro" structure (paragraphing) is a crucial first step and can immediately boost the score. The next, and final, hurdle is to fix the "micro" structure (sentence control).

## Final Learning Summary & Next Steps

    Paragraphing is Non-Negotiable: A clear, multi-paragraph structure is essential for a high score. You have successfully mastered this.

    Sentence Control is the Final Boss: Your most critical area for improvement is now applying the "25-Word Max" rule to your Task 2 essays. Your brilliant ideas deserve to be presented in clear, controlled, and grammatically correct sentences.

    One vs. Two Examples: The strategy of developing one powerful example per paragraph is highly effective for demonstrating depth in your argument.

It could be strongly struggling  for some people to bring balance to their personal lives and that with their professional characters.
In this essay, I will explore roots of this disturbing as well as the treatments, preventions, or other approaches towards it.
Firstly, I will give some on real-life examples of this issue with details and secondly I will illustrate potential solutions these instances specifically.

It can be argued that digitalization of aspects of everyday-life has dramatically changed the way of working, especially for working  arranging for locations and time.
And that can lead to weaken the boundaries of personal and professional lives.
Since we have entered post-covid19 era, which partially forced people to  get used to remote working, this way of contributing to work is trendy now in a certain degree.
For example, software developers now can work from home for almost every working day, which sound to be attractive, but actually it will let developers to work with longer
time.Because all management levels care about today is the completed degree level, and will use remote working as an excuse to question developers, like bug solving rate, and continuous success rate.But these developments required time to run these configured pipelines or workflows on virtual machines for some time, which usually will take no less than half an hour.Hence, this burdens developers more in style of remote working.
Another example will be the transformation of private communication application to work oriented goals.
Such as Line app, which used to be an app for personal app for private chat with one’s friends or family members.
But nowadays, companies actually are forcing employees to join line groups of companies to have conversations about works, and even at night or break time for regular employees.
And that can be extremely annoying for some people to hear the notification sound from their mobile phone, even becoming afraid of it.

Now as for solution for first possible situation, which is boundaries for work life balance becomes ambiguous  for short, using agile development methods may help.
Since agile required tremendous, great qualified and in-time communications with every team members, not just coders, it can help every one to track schedules and make their own plans.
Resulting clear records for every workers and the relevance with every threads, achievements, problems, and other related topics, by which, can guarantee  the accountability of every issues.
And protect as well as improve employees themselves by this methods.
Next, for communication application disturbing, there’s actually an elegant solution.
Using work purpose apps like Slack or Discord for conversations inside company, and others, like line, telegram, or messenger for private chats.
Then use scheduled notification disable function, which is a built-in feature in both iOS  and android devices, to silence Slack and Discord when off work.
By this combination of techs, mobile phones will notify only friends and family members when one is taking break.

To sum up, progress in digitalization could make people to loss their control of boundaries for work life balance.
But with proper methods or tools implemented, these issues can be solved in a certain degree, but will require the cooperation of  team members as well as companies, especially decision making groups.
