## ✍️ **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
Some argued that human shall adjust to technology, whiles others considered conversely.

Furthermore, it has become a vital issue that technology will downgrade our mind, such as knowledge or experience.

In these essay, I will discuss the which one is more suitable, humans adjust to technology or the opposite situation.

And secondly I will explore the concept that technology will negatively impact our brain functions.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Technology Should Adapt to Humans**
"Technology origins from humanity" presented by a global IT corporation, which reveals the nature of the relationship between human and technology.

Since technology was built to serve people, like phones, cars, even Artificial Intelligence related infrastructures, they all share the same goal, to serve human.

**Example:** For example, due to eliminate nuclear threats, some countries were seeking green energy such as solar, wind, and dam based water generated methods.

How ever, some experts confirmed that green energy types are inefficient and will cause more carbon footprint.

And thus, controllable nuclear fusion should be developed, since it causes so few damage but provides so tremendous power and works truly effetely.

As a result, some European scientists announced first controllable nuclear fusion electricity generator will be launched around 2028.

In this case, we can see that technology transformed to the types and forms by requirements of human, which proves technology shall definitely adjust to human, and to our needs.

### **Body Paragraph 2: Technology Makes Us Intellectually Weaker**
As for impacting our intelligence, from my aspect, I agree with technologies making us intellectually weaker.

Furthermore, this is a negative infinite loop, while people become less intelligent, they rely on technologies more, and the process goes on and on, which is quite note worthy.

**Example:** For instance, nowadays, college students majored in computer science usually use so called "vibe coding", which is an edge-cutting development methods.

However, this development way merely allow students to prompt Large Language Model embedded inside their IDE to generate basic code frame work.

And if students have no idea how the projects structure, code function, architecture, credentials and all the remaining components, they are basically not learning anything.

Moreover, they stick to the LLM so much that they are almost attached and addicted.

Combine with shallow learning progress and addicted to AI vibe coding in this example, it's true that technologies making us less intellectually.

### **Conclusion**
To sum up, technologies are created by human, hence the product, technologies should adapt to their customers, which is us.

If the majority of we have to be adjusted to technologies, it probably won't making lives better, so as a result, I strongly disagree that human shall adjust to technology.

And it can be sadly true that technologies may make us less smart, by providing ease-to-use user interface, though with thousands of unfilled knowledge gap.

Moreover, technologies may drag users into a spinning harmful infinite loops via poison packed with sweet appearance, convenient, thus make users become addicted.

- ❌ You have abandoned the "short sentence discipline" from your successful Task 1 practice and have returned to writing very long, complex sentences that are difficult to control

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- ❌ **Lack of Clarity:** The paragraph about nuclear fusion is very hard to follow because the sentences are long and the logical steps are strung together
- ❌ **Frequent Errors:** This lack of control leads to frequent grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement, incorrect word forms, and punctuation mistakes

### **Sentence Surgery Example:**

#### **Your Original (Problem):**
> "And thus, controllable nuclear fusion should be developed, since it causes so few damage but provides so tremendous power and works truly effetely."

#### **"Diet" Version (Solution):**
> "Therefore, some argue that controllable nuclear fusion should be developed. This is because it is expected to cause very little damage while providing tremendous power and working very effectively."

**By breaking your one long sentence into two shorter, clearer ones, the idea becomes much easier to understand, and the grammatical errors can be more easily spotted and fixed.**
