## ‚úçÔ∏è **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
It could be strongly struggling for some people to bring balance to their personal lives and that with their professional characters.

In this essay, I will explore roots of this disturbing as well as the treatments, preventions, or other approaches towards it.

Firstly, I will give some on real-life examples of this issue with details and secondly I will illustrate potential solutions these instances specifically.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Problems Caused by Poor Work-Life Balance**
It can be argued that digitalization of aspects of everyday-life has dramatically changed the way of working, especially for working arranging for locations and time.

And that can lead to weaken the boundaries of personal and professional lives.

Since we have entered post-covid19 era, which partially forced people to get used to remote working, this way of contributing to work is trendy now in a certain degree.

**Example:** For example, software developers now can work from home for almost every working day, which sound to be attractive, but actually it will let developers to work with longer time. Because all management levels care about today is the completed degree level, and will use remote working as an excuse to question developers, like bug solving rate, and continuous success rate. But these developments required time to run these configured pipelines or workflows on virtual machines for some time, which usually will take no less than half an hour. Hence, this burdens developers more in style of remote working.

Another example will be the transformation of private communication application to work oriented goals.

Such as Line app, which used to be an app for personal app for private chat with one's friends or family members.

But nowadays, companies actually are forcing employees to join line groups of companies to have conversations about works, and even at night or break time for regular employees.

And that can be extremely annoying for some people to hear the notification sound from their mobile phone, even becoming afraid of it.

### **Body Paragraph 2: Solutions to Work-Life Balance Problems**
To solve this issue, from my point of view, there are several approaches.

First will be establishing clear boundaries between personal and professional lives.

**Example:** For instance, it would be helpful for individuals to set up specific time for working, and specific time for personal lives.

And during personal time, all work related activities should be avoided, such as answering working phone calls, replying working emails, or even thinking about working.

Second approach will be developing time management skills.

For example, individuals can use time blocking method to allocate specific time slots for different activities.

This can help them to be more organized and efficient, thus reducing the need to work overtime.

Third approach will be seeking support from employers or colleagues.

For instance, individuals can communicate with their supervisors about their workload and ask for help when needed.

This can help to reduce stress and prevent burnout.

### **Conclusion**
To sum up, poor work-life balance can cause various problems including stress, health issues, and relationship problems.

However, these problems can be overcome by establishing clear boundaries, developing time management skills, and seeking support from others.

It is important for individuals to take proactive steps to maintain a healthy work-life balance for their overall well-being.
