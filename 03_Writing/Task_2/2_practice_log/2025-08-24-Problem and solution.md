Many people find it hard to balance their work with other parts of their lives. What problems does this cause? How can this problem be overcome?

Answer______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

It could be strongly struggling for some people to bring balance to their personal lives and that with their professional characters.

In this essay, I will explore roots of this disturbing as well as the treatments, preventions, or other approaches towards it.

Firstly, I will give some on real-life examples of this issue with details and secondly I will illustrate potential solutions these instances specifically.

It can be argued that digitalization of aspects of everyday-life has dramatically changed the way of working, especially for working arranging for locations and time.

And that can lead to weaken the boundaries of personal and professional lives.

Since we have entered post-covid19 era, which partially forced people to get used to remote working, this way of contributing to work is trendy now in a certain degree.

For example, software developers now can work from home for almost every working day, which sound to be attractive, but actually it will let developers to work with longer

time.Because all management levels care about today is the completed degree level, and will use remote working as an excuse to question developers, like bug solving rate, and continuous success rate.But these developments required time to run these configured pipelines or workflows on virtual machines for some time, which usually will take no less than half an hour.Hence, this burdens developers more in style of remote working.

Another example will be the transformation of private communication application to work oriented goals.

Such as Line app, which used to be an app for personal app for private chat with one’s friends or family members.

But nowadays, companies actually are forcing employees to join line groups of companies to have conversations about works, and even at night or break time for regular employees.

And that can be extremely annoying for some people to hear the notification sound from their mobile phone, even becoming afraid of it.

Now as for solution for first possible situation, which is boundaries for work life balance becomes ambiguous for short, using agile development methods may help.

Since agile required tremendous, great qualified and in-time communications with every team members, not just coders, it can help every one to track schedules and make their own plans.

Resulting clear records for every workers and the relevance with every threads, achievements, problems, and other related topics, by which, can guarantee the accountability of every issues.

And protect as well as improve employees themselves by this methods.

Next, for communication application disturbing, there’s actually an elegant solution.

Using work purpose apps like Slack or Discord for conversations inside company, and others, like line, telegram, or messenger for private chats.

Then use scheduled notification disable function, which is a built-in feature in both iOS and android devices, to silence Slack and Discord when off work.

By this combination of techs, mobile phones will notify only friends and family members when one is taking break.

To sum up, progress in digitalization could make people to loss their control of boundaries for work life balance.

But with proper methods or tools implemented, these issues can be solved in a certain degree, but will require the cooperation of team members as well as companies, especially decision making groups.

## Detailed Analysis

Task Response: Band 8.0

Your ideas and examples are outstanding.

    Strengths: You fully answered both parts of the prompt. Your explanation of the problems is particularly strong, using highly specific and modern examples like remote software developers facing metric-based pressure and the misuse of personal chat apps like Line for work. These are sophisticated, Band 8+ insights.

Coherence and Cohesion: Band 5.0 (The Biggest Problem)

This is the area that most significantly lowers your score.

    The Fatal Flaw: You have written the entire body of your essay as one single, giant paragraph. In IELTS, clear paragraphing is essential. Each paragraph should represent a distinct idea. By combining the problems and solutions into one block of text, you have created a major structural error that makes your argument very difficult to follow.

    The Solution: You must break your ideas into separate, focused paragraphs. A clear structure for this essay would be:

        Paragraph 1: Introduction

        Paragraph 2: Discuss the Problems (e.g., blurring boundaries, stress from apps).

        Paragraph 3: Discuss the Solutions (e.g., agile methods, dedicated work apps).

        Paragraph 4: Conclusion

Lexical Resource (Vocabulary): Band 7.0

You used an excellent range of sophisticated vocabulary.

    Strengths: digitalization, post-covid19 era, configured pipelines, work-oriented goals, ambiguous, agile development methods, and elegant solution are all high-level and precise lexical choices.

    Minor Errors: Some small slips like strongly struggling (better: a significant struggle) and let developers to work (better: makes developers work) are present.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 5.5

This is the second major issue. Your sentence control has unfortunately regressed in this essay.

    The Return of the "Monster Sentence": You have abandoned the "short sentence discipline." The essay is full of long, rambling sentences that are hard to read and contain grammatical errors.

    The Sentence Fragment: The fragment error has also returned: Resulting clear records for every workers... This cannot stand alone as a sentence. It should be connected to the previous idea, for example: ...make their own plans. This results in clear records...

## Action Plan: Rebuilding the Foundation

You have proven that you can generate Band 8+ ideas. That is the hardest part, and you have mastered it. Now, we must fix the "container" you put these ideas in.

Your mission for the next essay is to go back to basics and focus 100% on structure and control.

    Mandatory Paragraphing: Before you write, plan your four distinct paragraphs (Intro, Body 1, Body 2, Conclusion). Give each paragraph a clear, single purpose.

    Strictly Enforce the "25-Word Max" Rule: This is non-negotiable. You must return to the discipline of writing shorter, clearer sentences. This will automatically improve your grammar and clarity.

This is not a problem of ideas; it is a problem of "packaging." You have brilliant ideas. Now, let's build the perfect structure to present them in.
