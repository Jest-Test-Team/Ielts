Write about the following topic:

Should humans adjust to technology or should technology be adjusted to us? Is technology making us intellectually weaker or more intelligent?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

___

answer

___

Some argued that human shall adjust to technology, whiles others considered conversely.

Furthermore, it has  become a vital issue that technology will downgrade our mind , such as knowledge or experience.

In these essay, I will discuss the which one is more suitable, humans adjust to technology or the opposite situation.

And secondly I  will  explore the concept that technology will negatively impact our brain functions 


“Technology origins from humanity” presented by a global IT corporation, which reveals the nature of the relationship between human and technology.

Since technology was built to serve people, like phones, cars, even Artificial Intelligence related infrastructures, they all share the same goal, to serve human.

For example, due to eliminate nuclear threats, some countries were seeking green energy such as solar, wind, and dam based water generated methods.

How ever, some experts confirmed that  green energy types are inefficient  and will cause more carbon footprint .

And thus, controllable nuclear fusion should be developed, since it causes so few damage but provides so tremendous power and works truly effetely.

As a result, some European scientists  announced first controllable nuclear fusion electricity generator will be launched around 2028.

In this case, we can see that technology transformed to the types and forms by requirements of human, which proves technology shall definitely adjust to human , and  to  our needs.


As for impacting our intelligence, from my aspect, I agree with technologies making us intellectually weaker.

Furthermore, this is a negative infinite loop, while people become less intelligent, they rely on technologies more, and the process goes on and on, which is quite note worthy.

For instance, nowadays, college students majored in computer science usually use so called “vibe coding”, which is an edge-cutting development methods.

However, this development way merely allow students to prompt Large Language Model embedded inside their IDE to generate basic code frame work.

And if students have no idea how the projects structure, code function, architecture, credentials and all the remaining components, they are basically not learning anything.

Moreover, they stick to the LLM so much that they are almost attached and addicted.

Combine with shallow learning progress and addicted to AI vibe coding in this example, it’s true that technologies making us less intellectually.


To sum up, technologies are created by human, hence the product, technologies should adapt to their customers, which is  us.

If the majority of we have to be adjusted to technologies, it probably won’t making lives better , so as a result, I strongly disagree that human shall adjust to technology

And it can be sadly true that technologies may  make us less smart, by providing ease-to-use user interface, though  with thousands of unfilled knowledge gap.

Moreover, technologies may drag users into a spinning harmful infinite loops via poison packed with sweet appearance, convenient, thus make users become addicted. 

___
Overall Estimated Band Score: 7.0

## Detailed Analysis

Task Response: Band 7.5

Your response fully and effectively addresses both parts of the prompt.

    Strengths: Your arguments are clear, logical, and well-supported. The example of "vibe coding" leading to shallow learning is a perfect, well-explained point to support your argument that technology can make us intellectually weaker. Your position on both questions is clear.

Coherence and Cohesion: Band 7.0

The overall structure of your essay is logical and easy to follow.

    Strengths: You have a clear four-paragraph structure. Your introduction sets out the plan, each body paragraph addresses one of the prompt's questions, and your conclusion summarizes your points effectively.

Lexical Resource (Vocabulary): Band 7.5

Your vocabulary range is a significant strength of this essay.

    Strengths: You used a wide range of high-level and precise vocabulary, such as conversely, vital issue, infrastructures, nuclear fusion, tremendous power, and shallow learning. This shows a strong command of the language.

    Minor Errors: There are a few spelling and word choice errors (whiles instead of while, How ever instead of However, effetely instead of effectively), but they do not generally impede communication.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 6.0 (The Main Weakness)

This is the one area that is significantly limiting your score.

    The Problem: Your essay is like a Formula 1 car with a powerful engine (your ideas and vocabulary) but with very loose steering (your sentence control). You have abandoned the "short sentence discipline" from your successful Task 1 practice and have returned to writing very long, complex sentences that are difficult to control.

    The Consequences:

        Lack of Clarity: The paragraph about nuclear fusion is very hard to follow because the sentences are long and the logical steps are strung together.

        Frequent Errors: This lack of control leads to frequent grammatical errors, including subject-verb agreement, incorrect word forms, and punctuation mistakes.

## Action Plan: The Path to 8.0

The path to a Band 8.0 score for you is not about learning more complex ideas or vocabulary—you already have those. It is 100% about improving your grammatical accuracy by controlling your sentence length.

Let's perform "sentence surgery" on a section from your first body paragraph:

    Your version: And thus, controllable nuclear fusion should be developed, since it causes so few damage but provides so tremendous power and works truly effetely.

    "Diet" version with improved clarity: Therefore, some argue that controllable nuclear fusion should be developed. This is because it is expected to cause very little damage while providing tremendous power and working very effectively.

By breaking your one long sentence into two shorter, clearer ones, the idea becomes much easier to understand, and the grammatical errors can be more easily spotted and fixed.

You have the most difficult part of writing mastered: generating excellent ideas. Now, you just need to apply the same discipline to your Task 2 sentence structure that you did for your Task 1 writing. I am certain that once you do this, your score will see another major breakthrough.
