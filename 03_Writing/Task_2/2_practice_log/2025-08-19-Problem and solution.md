## ✍️ **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
Recently, tremendous amounts of food provided from stores and restaurants are wasted by people.

In this essay, I will explore the reasons why people waste food and they might be solved.

Firstly, I'll focus on the major reasons causing food waste and secondly I'll demonstrate the solutions.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Causes of Food Waste**
Food from stores and restaurants usually are prepared for people with intense life pace, who don't have time for relaxing eating process.

As a result, once they fell almost full, they will not consume remaining food and dispose them, because they are assigned to do other tasks which is more urgent.

Furthermore, some stores and restaurants developed fast food style to fulfill this requirement, which will make disposing food easier for customers.

**Example:** For instance, some fas food restaurants providing fried chicken, develop their chicken wings can be eat easily and fast.

However, once customer finished their fried chick fast, there will be few remaining meat attached on the chick bones.

Customers usually just throw them away, while there is still some nutritious meat attached to the bones, hence cause food waste.

### **Body Paragraph 2: Solutions to Food Waste**
To solve this issue, in my opinion, policies or guidelines established by govenment and education actions should be planned, designed, and implemented.

By setting up food waste related policies, penalties included, stores and restaurants will and must re-design or adjust their product.

And by following guidelines based on policies, the concept, schedule, and limitation of re-design or adjusting will be strongly clear for stores and restaurants to follow.

Results in new food type that waste less are served widely, thus reduce food waste.

**Example:** As for customers, from my point of view, it's more suitable to educate them the concept of food waste, especially downwards.

Via school education and public promotion, customers can realize how to stop wasting food.

And through combine them together, it will be an efficent solution.

### **Conclusion**
In conclusion, from my aspect, food waste is caused by lifestyle of modern people, which is amplified by food providers like stores and restaurants.

In order to solve it, establishing proper policies and education systems will be critical, since it's a systematic problem, in my opinion.
