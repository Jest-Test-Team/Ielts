## ‚úçÔ∏è **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
It is often argued that some individuals put more efforts in education and working than others do.

In this essay, I will discuss reasons about why some people work harder in these fields than others do and pros and cons of hard working.

Firstly, I will explore some potential root causes for first question and secondly I will show some examples and scenarios for second question.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Why Some People Work Harder**
Generally, it is considered that outstanding scores or achievements in academic performance can bring out better opportunities of one's career path.

Furthermore, career path can definitely impact the majority of one's whole live since most people have to work for living for quite a long time.

**Example:** For instance, in South Korea, it has been exposed that if a student worked hard enough, he or she will have a higher possibility to get into the top three universities in that country.

And almost all promising positions in South Korea provided by large companies, only accept those graduated form these 3 universities.

What's more, even graduates successfully taking offers from these great firms, will still facing lots of competition.

For example, KPI comparison with colleges in Samsung ltd, or quantification working assessment by managers in KIA ltd.

Thus both education and employment require lots of efforts for those want to live relatively stable life in South Korea for strong competitive environments there.

### **Body Paragraph 2: When Hard Work May Not Be Good**
However, not all situations suit for hard woking.

If one's goals are with unethical purposes, it won't be a good thing to work hard, from my point of view.

**Example:** Take some black hat hackers on dark web for instance, their goal is usually to gain large volume of fortune, but with lots of efforts with methods against laws.

Using way of silk for example, used to the largest exchange platform for illegal drugs, violence related services, and even sexual trading on dark web, the founder did work extremely hard to build the distributed site to gain wealth.

Though the founder did gain billions of dollars, his way of profiting was totally intolerant since involved unethical activities globally, even encouraging people to commit crimes.

### **Conclusion**
To sum up, people work harder in education and employment due to competitive environments and the desire for better opportunities.

However, hard work is not always beneficial when it involves unethical purposes or illegal activities.

Therefore, while hard work is generally admirable, it should be directed toward positive and legal goals.
