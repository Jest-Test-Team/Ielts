___

answer

___

It is often argued that some individuals put more efforts in education and working than others do.

In this essay, I will discuss reasons about why some people work harder in these fields than others do and pros and cons of hard working.

Firstly, I will explore some potential root causes for first question and secondly I will show some examples and scenarios for second question.


Generally, it is considered that outstanding scores or achievements in academic performance can bring out better opportunities of one’s career path.

Furthermore, career path can definitely impact the majority of one’s whole live since most people have to work for living for quite a long time.

For instance, in South Korea, it has been exposed that if a student worked hard enough, he or she will have a higher possibility to get into the top three universities in that country.

And almost all promising positions in South Korea provided by large companies, only accept those graduated form these 3 universities.

What’s more, even graduates successfully taking offers from these great firms, will still facing lots of competition.

For example, KPI  comparison with colleges in Samsung ltd, or quantification working assessment by managers in KIA ltd.

Thus both  education and employment require lots of efforts for those want to live relatively stable life in South Korea for strong competitive environments there.


However, not all situations suit for hard woking.

If one’s goals are with unethical purposes, it won’t be a good thing to work hard, from my point of view.

Take some black hat hackers on dark web for instance, their goal is usually to gain large volume of fortune, but with lots of efforts with methods against laws.

Using way of silk for example, used to the largest exchange platform for illegal drugs, violence related services, and even sexual trading on dark web, the founder did work extremely hard to build the distributed site to gain wealth.

Though the founder did gain billions of dollars, his way of profiting was totally intolerant since involved unethical activities globally, even encouraging people to commit crimes.

Also, ironically and noteworthy, he ended up in jail, and all his wealth, most of them are bitcoins, are taken over by the government of united states of America.

By this case, it can be said that hard working with illegal or unethical direction, purpose , or goals, should never be  proceed.

Hence, it’s not always a good thing to work hard.


To sum up with, in common and most scenes, it would be beneficial for people to work hard in education and employment fields to have stable, joyful lives.

But the actions as well as their goals must be trying to achieve wellness and never break laws in any circumstances.

Otherwise, not only just their lives, but others’ may be ruined.
