____

In recent years, computers have become more widely accessible for people and lots of kids are now able to play games on computers.

In this essay, I will discuss the upside and the downside of playing computer games, and demonstrate my potential solution to minimize the negative impact of it.

Firstly, I will focus on the benefits and positive impact that playing computer games might have and secondly I will discuss the potential drawback of this behavior then the possible solution to protect computer game players.


Playing computer games can bring several merits to players, while thinking strategies and learning historical information could be the most notice-worthy ones.

When players gain ability to think strategically and some new piece of information from computer games, they could also implement these skills or knowledge in their routine lives.

For instance,one most obvious advantage that playing computer games might be learning to construct strategies thinking and cooperate with team mates, which can be observed in  online MOBA(multiplayer online battle arena) games like League of Legends, Overwatch, or even Virus INC.

While players are forced to be set into 2 teams, at least, with same goals to fight for, those on the same team must develop, construct, and implement their plans, usually with logically stages, better than their competitors do, involving deeply thinking, intense real-time communication, and action to incidents.

Another example would be historical background settings inside games, if accurately configured, like the officially recored black samurai , Saskei, showed up in the game Assassins’ Guilt in 17 century in Japan, may indeed bring players some not-common history related knowledge.



However, on the other hand,  computer games can also negatively impact players in multiple ways , while gaming addition and occupying time for other activities might be considered the most critical ones.

It has been proven that under certain circumstances, players will be too addicted to there virtual sandbox world inside their computer, hence spend most of their time on playing computer games, instead of fulfill their obligations or other responsibilities.

For example, student players can be so addicted to their games that they often skip classes and completely ignore their homework or club activities, which will not only  damage their academic performance, but their social lives.

One potential approach to these situation will be to use school education system, peers’ impact and parenting, to bring out and emphasize that though computer games can be fun, atractive and might also be educational, learning reasonable allocating ones time for gaming and other activities is also extremely important.


To sum up, computer games have their pros and cons for players, which depends on players playing attitude and routine habit.

And from my aspect, to minimize negative effects, it is important for players to know that carefully schedule times for gaming and other activities, which may not be ignored, via sorts of environments and sources, like schools, peers, and family. 


___
Overall Estimated Band Score: 6.0

This is a consistent Band 6.0 essay, meaning it's a competent response but has noticeable flaws in structure and language that prevent it from reaching the 6.5 or 7.0 level.

## Detailed Analysis

Task Response: Band 6.0

You successfully addressed all three parts of the prompt: the positives, the negatives, and the solutions. Your ideas, such as strategic thinking from MOBA games and the risk of addiction, are relevant and well-supported with examples.

The main weakness here is uneven development. You dedicated an entire, well-developed paragraph to the positive impacts. However, you crammed both the negative impacts AND the solutions into a single paragraph. This means the "solutions" part of your argument was underdeveloped, reduced to a single sentence at the end. To score higher, each part of the question needs to be given adequate, balanced attention.

Coherence and Cohesion: Band 6.0

Your essay has a clear introduction and conclusion, and you use linking words like Firstly, However, and To sum up to guide the reader.

The primary issue is the flawed paragraphing. As mentioned above, combining the "negatives" and "solutions" into one body paragraph disrupts the logical flow of the essay. A much clearer and higher-scoring structure for this specific question would be a five-paragraph essay:

    Introduction

    Body Paragraph 1: Positive Impacts

    Body Paragraph 2: Negative Impacts

    Body Paragraph 3: Solutions

    Conclusion

This structure gives each part of your argument its own dedicated space, making your essay more logical and easier to follow.

Lexical Resource (Vocabulary): Band 6.0

You used a good range of relevant vocabulary, including terms like strategically, cooperate, virtual sandbox world, addicted, and academic performance.

However, the score is limited by frequent errors in spelling, word choice, and word formation. Some key examples include:

    gaming addition: This should be gaming addiction. This is a critical spelling error as it changes the meaning of a key term in your argument.

    Assassins’ Guilt: The game is called Assassin's Creed. While examiners are not expected to be gaming experts, obvious factual errors in examples can weaken their credibility.

    strategies thinking: This should be strategic thinking.

    atractive: This should be attractive.

    to there virtual: This should be to their virtual.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 6.0

You attempted a good variety of complex sentence structures, which is great for showing grammatical range. Your sentence control is also much better, and you've avoided the "monster sentences" from previous Task 1 practices.

The main issue here is the return of an old enemy: the sentence fragment.

    Your sentence: ...better than their competitors do, involving deeply thinking, intense real-time communication, and action to incidents.

    The problem: The part starting with involving... is a fragment; it cannot stand on its own.

    The fix: You need to connect it to the main clause, for example: ...better than their competitors do, a process that **involves** deep thinking...

There are also other minor errors, such as One potential approach to these situation will be... (should be ...to this situation would be...). The frequency of these small errors, combined with the sentence fragments, limits your grammar score.

## Action Plan for Your Next Essay

You have excellent ideas. The path to a higher score is very clear and achievable.

    Adopt the Five-Paragraph Structure: For questions with multiple parts like this one, give each part its own body paragraph. This is the single most important change you can make.

    Hunt Down Your "Enemies": Before you finish, do a quick search for your personal recurring errors:

        Check for sentence fragments (especially those starting with -ing verbs).

        Double-check the spelling of key topic words (like addiction).

    Refine Your Examples: Make sure the names and facts in your examples are as accurate as possible to make your arguments more convincing.
