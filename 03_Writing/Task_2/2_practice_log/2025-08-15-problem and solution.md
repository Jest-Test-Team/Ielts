## ‚úçÔ∏è **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
In recent years, computers have become more widely accessible for people and lots of kids are now able to play games on computers.

In this essay, I will discuss the upside and the downside of playing computer games, and demonstrate my potential solution to minimize the negative impact of it.

Firstly, I will focus on the benefits and positive impact that playing computer games might have and secondly I will discuss the potential drawback of this behavior then the possible solution to protect computer game players.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Positive Impacts**
Playing computer games can bring several merits to players, while thinking strategies and learning historical information could be the most notice-worthy ones.

When players gain ability to think strategically and some new piece of information from computer games, they could also implement these skills or knowledge in their routine lives.

**Example:** For instance, one most obvious advantage that playing computer games might be learning to construct strategies thinking and cooperate with team mates, which can be observed in online MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) games like League of Legends, Overwatch, or even Virus INC.

While players are forced to be set into 2 teams, at least, with same goals to fight for, those on the same team must develop, construct, and implement their plans, usually with logically stages, better than their competitors do, involving deeply thinking, intense real-time communication, and action to incidents.

Another example would be historical background settings inside games, if accurately configured, like the officially recorded black samurai, Saskei, showed up in the game Assassins' Creed in 17th century in Japan, may indeed bring players some not-common history related knowledge.

### **Body Paragraph 2: Negative Impacts & Solutions**
However, on the other hand, computer games can also negatively impact players in multiple ways, while gaming addiction and occupying time for other activities might be considered the most critical ones.

It has been proven that under certain circumstances, players will be too addicted to their virtual sandbox world inside their computer, hence spend most of their time on playing computer games, instead of fulfill their obligations or other responsibilities.

**Example:** For example, student players can be so addicted to their games that they often skip classes and completely ignore their homework or club activities, which will not only damage their academic performance, but their social lives.

**Solution:** One potential approach to these situation will be to use school education system, peers' impact and parenting, to bring out and emphasize that though computer games can be fun, attractive and might also be educational, learning reasonable allocating ones time for gaming and other activities is also extremely important.

### **Conclusion**
To sum up, computer games have their pros and cons for players, which depends on players playing attitude and routine habit.

And from my aspect, to minimize negative effects, it is important for players to know that carefully schedule times for gaming and other activities, which may not be ignored, via sorts of environments and sources, like schools, peers, and family.

## üîç **Detailed Analysis**

### **Task Response: Band 6.0** üéØ

You successfully addressed all three parts of the prompt: the positives, the negatives, and the solutions. Your ideas, such as strategic thinking from MOBA games and the risk of addiction, are relevant and well-supported with examples.

#### **Main Weakness:**
The main weakness here is uneven development. You dedicated an entire, well-developed paragraph to the positive impacts. However, you crammed both the negative impacts AND the solutions into a single paragraph. This means the "solutions" part of your argument was underdeveloped, reduced to a single sentence at the end.

---

### **Coherence and Cohesion: Band 6.0** üîó

Your essay has a clear introduction and conclusion, and you use linking words like Firstly, However, and To sum up to guide the reader.

#### **Primary Issue:**
The primary issue is the flawed paragraphing. As mentioned above, combining the "negatives" and "solutions" into one body paragraph disrupts the logical flow of the essay.

#### **Better Structure:**
A much clearer and higher-scoring structure for this specific question would be a five-paragraph essay:

| **Paragraph** | **Content** | **Purpose** |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Introduction** | Hook + Thesis + Outline | Set the roadmap |
| **Body 1** | Positive Impacts | Discuss benefits |
| **Body 2** | Negative Impacts | Discuss drawbacks |
| **Body 3** | Solutions | Propose solutions |
| **Conclusion** | Summary + Restatement | Wrap up effectively |

### **Lexical Resource (Vocabulary): Band 6.0** üí¨

You used a good range of relevant vocabulary, including terms like strategically, cooperate, virtual sandbox world, addicted, and academic performance.

#### **Score Limitations:**
However, the score is limited by frequent errors in spelling, word choice, and word formation:

| **Error** | **Should Be** | **Impact** |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| `gaming addition` | `gaming addiction` | Critical spelling error |
| `Assassins' Guilt` | `Assassin's Creed` | Factual error |
| `strategies thinking` | `strategic thinking` | Word form error |
| `atractive` | `attractive` | Spelling error |
| `to there virtual` | `to their virtual` | Grammar error |

---

### **Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 6.0** üìö

You attempted a good variety of complex sentence structures, which is great for showing grammatical range. Your sentence control is also much better, and you've avoided the "monster sentences" from previous Task 1 practices.

#### **Main Issue:**
The main issue here is the return of an old enemy: the sentence fragment.

**Your sentence:** `...better than their competitors do, involving deeply thinking, intense real-time communication, and action to incidents.`

**The problem:** The part starting with `involving...` is a fragment; it cannot stand on its own.

**The fix:** You need to connect it to the main clause, for example: `...better than their competitors do, a process that **involves** deep thinking...`

## üöÄ **Action Plan for Your Next Essay**

You have excellent ideas. The path to a higher score is very clear and achievable.

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Adopt the Five-Paragraph Structure:** For questions with multiple parts like this one, give each part its own body paragraph
2. **Hunt Down Your "Enemies":** Before you finish, do a quick search for your personal recurring errors:
   - Check for sentence fragments (especially those starting with -ing verbs)
   - Double-check the spelling of key topic words (like addiction)
3. **Refine Your Examples:** Make sure the names and facts in your examples are as accurate as possible

## üí° **Key Learning Points**

- **Structure Matters:** Give each part of your argument its own dedicated space
- **Balance Development:** Ensure all parts of the question receive equal attention
- **Proofread Carefully:** Many errors can be caught with a final review
- **Use Accurate Examples:** Factual errors can undermine your credibility
