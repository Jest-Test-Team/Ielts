## ✍️ **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
Recently, the major visitors of museums and historic sites are now visited more by tourists instead of the locals.

In this essay, I'll explore the causing factors of this trend, and then propose my solution to address them.

Firstly, I would like to give examples and details toward these issues and secondly present my actual solving methods.

### **Body Paragraph 1: The Problem**
It can be argued that humans are creature that could be more curious about others' possessions, whether physical or in other formats.

Thus it's not surprising that most people pay lots of attention to historical related sites and museums located outside their range of routine lifes.

Furthermore, some may even argued that these spots have been commercialized by the force of capitalism and governments, causing less attraction to locals.

**Example:** Using Taipei Art Museum for example, residents lived in Taipei usually don't pay visits to it, since it's close to them hence losing the feeling of excitement.

Also, worth mentioning, Taipei Fine Art Museum gradually developed with more gift shops and attached season-limited markets, which are supported by Taipei government and sponsored by firms.

These activities and units sell common crafts can be seen around in Taipei, which can be attractive to tourists, but could be useless for citizens there.

### **Body Paragraph 2: The Solution**
In order to solve this issue, it could be helpful to focusing on holding creative and fresh activities and cut off some commercial units in museums and historic sites.

**Example:** For instance, using Taipei Art Museum still, there used to be some occasional events attract locals more.

One would be the public-facing interview session with a famous movie director, Wei-De Sheng, who directed a film about Taipei back to the period colonized by Japan.

And the interview was without any commercial elements, but still a huge success with thousands of people, almost exceeded the maximum capacity of Taipei Fine Art Museum.

Many citizens were truly satisfied by the freshness and off-selling of this event and hope to have more similar ones held.

### **Conclusion**
To sum up, lack of freshness for being around and too many selling products may caused local residents loss motivations to visit these locations.

On the contrary, tourists will have more motivations for being unfamiliar with the sites or areas.

To solve these issues, frequently holding constructive and fleshing events without merchandise-selling purposes could help.

For locals can gain excitements and feel less for being forced to purchase crafts around museums and historic sites.

- ❌ In IELTS Task 2, there is no separate 'Overall' paragraph

- ❌ An essay should have only four paragraphs: Introduction, Body 1, Body 2, and Conclusion

## 🏆 **The "Golden Standard" Version of Your Essay (Band 8.5+)**

Here is how we can take your excellent ideas and format them into a flawless, four-paragraph essay that would achieve a very high score.

### **Paragraph 1: Introduction**
It is often observed that museums and historic sites are now visited more by tourists than by local residents. While some argue this is a natural consequence of proximity and commercialization, these issues can be addressed through targeted engagement. This essay will first explore the reasons for this trend and then propose that museums can attract more local visitors by hosting unique, non-commercial events.

### **Paragraph 2: Body 1 - The Causes**
It can be argued that humans are creatures that are often more curious about others' possessions, whether physical or cultural. Thus, it is not surprising that most people pay more attention to historical sites and museums located outside the range of their routine lives. Furthermore, these spots have often been over-commercialized by the forces of capitalism and governments, causing less attraction for locals. At the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, for example, residents of the city often do not pay visits, since its proximity removes the feeling of excitement. Moreover, the museum has gradually developed more gift shops and seasonal markets which, while attractive to tourists, sell common crafts that are of little interest to local citizens.

### **Paragraph 3: Body 2 - The Solutions**
In order to solve this issue, it would be helpful for these institutions to focus on holding creative and fresh activities while cutting back on some commercial units. For instance, the Taipei Fine Arts Museum has previously hosted occasional events that were highly attractive to locals. One such event was a public interview session with the famous movie director, Wei Te-Sheng, who directed a film about Taipei during the Japanese colonial period. The interview had no commercial elements but was still a huge success, drawing thousands of people and almost exceeding the museum's maximum capacity. Many citizens were truly satisfied by the freshness and non-commercial nature of this event and expressed a desire for more similar ones to be held.

### **Paragraph 4: Conclusion**
In conclusion, a lack of novelty and excessive commercialism may cause local residents to lose motivation to visit these locations, while tourists are naturally more interested due to their unfamiliarity. To address this, frequently holding constructive and fresh events without a primary focus on selling merchandise could be a powerful solution. This would not only provide excitement for locals but would also allow them to engage with their own culture without feeling pressured to make purchases.
