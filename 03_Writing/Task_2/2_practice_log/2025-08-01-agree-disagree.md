Some people believe that entertainers are paid too much and their

impact on society is negative, while others disagree and believe that

they deserve the money that they make because of their positive effects

on society. 

Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion. 

The

entertainment industry is one of the largest sectors in all around the

world. Some think that the people who work in that industry earn too

much money considering their bad influence on society, and I agree. 

Others, however, believe that their positive impact on others is worth

the money that they are paid.

On the one hand, there is no doubt

that show business is an enormous and unfairly well paid sector. In

addition to that, members of it do not add real value, compared to

others like, for instance, education workers. Although in some countries

teachers live with unreasonable wages, their responsibility, is

extremely valuable for next generations become better people. Whereas a

singer can earn double their yearly salary from one concert. The other

important point is, for a balanced and equal society, the difference

between income levels must not be very high. Regardless than their

contribution, no one should make billions of dollars that easily,

because that imbalance does have a significant negative impact on

societies.

On the other hand, some people think that entertainers’

contribution to the modern life is worth the money they earn. It can be

understood that for many people, watching a movie or going to a concert

is irreplaceable with other activities; therefore, they think that

their positive impact is crucial for a significant proportion of people.

In addition to that, celebrities do compromise their privacy and

freedom with being known by many others. In exchange of that, they do

deserve a comfortable life with significantly better paychecks.

In

conclusion, despite their minimal contribution with their work to the

people and sacrifice from their private life; I believe that their

impact is far from being positive and they are not paid fairly or

balanced with others. 

根據雅思的四個評分標準，逐一分析你的文章。

寫作任務回應 (Task Response) - Band 6

    優點 👍:

        你成功地回應了題目的所有要求：討論了「藝人收入過高且有負面影響」以及「藝人因其正面影響而值得高收入」這兩種觀點，並且清楚地給出了自己的立場。

        你的立場從頭到尾都相當明確 (在引言中說 and I agree，並在結論中重申)。

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        論點發展可以更深入：

            在第一段論述中，你提到藝人「沒有提供真正的價值」(do not add real value)，並將他們與教師比較。這是一個好的開始，但你可以更具體地說明藝人帶來的「壞影響」(bad influence) 是什麼。例如，他們是否推崇物質主義？他們的生活方式是否對年輕人有不良示範？

            在第二段論述中，你提到他們「犧牲了隱私」(compromise their privacy)，但這個論點與他們對社會的「正面貢獻」關聯性較弱。你可以多描述一些他們的正面影響，例如：他們的作品如何在人們壓力大時提供慰藉？他們是否會利用自己的影響力參與慈善活動？

💡 學習策略小提示： 寫作時，可以試著用「PEEL」架構來發展段落：

    P (Point): 提出你的觀點。

    E (Evidence/Example): 提供證據或具體例子。

    E (Explanation): 解釋你的例子如何支持你的觀點。

    L (Link): 將這個論點與題目或你的主旨連結起來。

連貫與銜接 (Coherence and Cohesion) - Band 6

    優點 👍:

        文章結構非常清晰，有引言、兩個主體段落和結論，邏輯流暢。

        段落劃分得當，每個段落都有一個中心思想。

        你使用了一些轉折詞來連接句子和段落，例如 On the one hand, On the other hand, In addition to that, Whereas, In conclusion。

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        連接詞可以更多樣化：你用了兩次 In addition to that。可以試著用 Furthermore, Moreover, 或 Another key point is that... 來替換，讓文章讀起來更有變化。

        句子間的連接：有些句子的開頭可以更流暢。例如：

            The other important point is, for a balanced and equal society...

            可以改成：Furthermore, for a society to be balanced and equal... 這樣會更自然。

詞彙資源 (Lexical Resource) - Band 6

    優點 👍:

        你使用了一些不錯的詞彙，例如 enormous sector, unreasonable wages, irreplaceable, compromise their privacy, significantly better paychecks。這顯示了你嘗試使用更多樣的單字。

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        用字錯誤 (Word Choice/Collocation)：有一些搭配詞和介系詞的錯誤，這在雅思寫作中是常見的挑戰，我們一起來修正它們！

            in all around the world  -> 應為 all around the world 或 around the world。

            Regardless than their contribution -> 應為 Regardless of their contribution。

            In exchange of that -> 應為 In exchange for that。

            sacrifice from their private life -> 應為 sacrifice their private life 或 make sacrifices in their private lives。

            paid fairly or balanced with others -> 應為 paid fairly or in a balanced way compared to others。

💡 學習策略小提示： 建立一個你自己的「單字筆記本」！當你學到一個新單字時，不只記下它的意思，還要記下它可以跟哪些字搭配 (collocations)，並試著自己造一個句子。這樣印象會更深刻喔！

文法廣度與準確性 (Grammatical Range and Accuracy) - Band 5

    優點 👍:

        你嘗試使用了不同的句型，包括簡單句和包含 Although, Whereas, because 的複合句。

    可改進之處 ✍️:

        文法和標點錯誤：文章中有一些重複出現的錯誤，雖然不至於完全影響理解，但會讓考官覺得你對文法的掌握度還不夠純熟。

            標點符號：...their responsibility, is extremely valuable... -> responsibility 後面的逗號應該拿掉。

            句子結構：...for next generations become better people. -> 應為 ...for future generations to become better people. (不定詞 to become)。

            冠詞：...is one of the largest sectors in all around the world. -> 應為 ...in the world.。
