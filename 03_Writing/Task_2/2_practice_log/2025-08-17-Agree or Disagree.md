## ✍️ **Student Essay**

### **Introduction**
People have different point of views on whether vacant spaces in urban areas should be used for building housing or eco friendly facilities.

In this essay, I'll discuss both these two options, and give my aspect of agree on disagree with constructing more housing facilities.

Firstly, I will explore expanding housing facilities and secondly I will explore expanding eco friendly facilities.

### **Body Paragraph 1: Arguments Against Housing Development**
While developing housing facilities in urban areas can provide more space for individuals to live, it could cause heating effect and make these areas extremely crowded.

These two issues can make urban areas less comfortable for citizens to live in, and furthermore, even produce disasters.

**Example:** For example, many mega cities in Asia, such as Tokyo, Soul, and Beijing, have transformed most of their vacant areas into housing facilities to let their citizens to live in.

However, these cities take in so many people, that the cities become extremely crowded.

We can see people not being to get on public transportation vehicles because the trunk of train or bus is full and leave with no space on news oftenly, which is inconvenient and uncomfortable for citizens.

Further more, after housing facilities are built, usually tall buildings, the heat from vehicle emission, like cars, motorcycles, bus, will be captured and contained, being not able to be released to atmosphere, inside urban area by these gigantic constructions, hence keeping heating up the areas at night.

Therefore, citizens are forced to use conditioner to cool their living place while at the same time, emit more heating gas out, and result in a damaging negative infinite loop, which can eventually cause deaths, especially in summer.

Though developing housing facilities in urban areas may indeed provide more living space for citizens to live, the drawbacks, crowed situation and heating loop, can lead to uncomfortable living condition and even cause deaths in some extreme scenarios.

Therefore, I disagree with housing facilities should be built in the vacant areas of cities and towns.

### **Body Paragraph 2: Arguments For Eco-Friendly Facilities**
On the other hand, expanding eco friendly facilities, would be a more suitable option from my aspect, for it can mitigate some effect brought by natural disasters, and can also benefit other species, instead of just human.

These two upsides can protect not just human but also all other creatures in ordinary situations, but also in disastrous ones, even strengthen the adaption abilities for urban areas.

**Example:** For instance, parks, pounds or small lakes, can be a buffer once rainfall suddenly exceeds the threshold that urban areas can consume.

And these eco friendly facilities, unlike concrete or marble made constructions, are able to absorb liquid into soil or to be a temporary storage natural tank, hence decrease the happening chance of flooding and it's damage range or degree.

Another example will be that eco friendly facilities can provide habitats for animals to live in in, especially parks with many trees. Though urban areas are man made, it's still important to remember that we don't possess the natural world, other species have their rights to living as well.

Moreover, by expanding eco friendly facilities, such as vacant areas specially reserved for planting trees, small animals can have their habitats and will decrease the possibilities for them to rush into restaurants, schools, or even our home, which can be also very tricky for us to deal with.

### **Conclusion**
To sum up, vacant areas with housing facilities, though provide more living places for individuals, can make these areas uncomfortable to live in, and with more possibilities to have more critical results like contained heat.

While, vacant areas with eco friendly facilities, like planting more trees, can ease damage caused by natural disaster and benefit other species.

From my aspect, vacant areas should be used for eco friendly facilities, for not just providing residents, including human and non-human, with better living qualities, but also a disaster prevention method about protecting residents' lives, properties, and ensure cities and towns are working functional.

Therefor, I agree with that parks should be set and planting trees is very important, while I disagree with the narrative that housing facilities should be built in the vacant areas of cities and towns.

## 🔍 **Detailed Analysis**

### **Task Response: Band 8.0** 🎯

This is an outstanding response to the prompt.

#### **Strengths:**
- ✅ **Clear Position:** Your position is made clear throughout the essay and is strongly restated in the conclusion
- ✅ **Well-Developed Arguments:** Your arguments are excellent. The idea of the "urban heat island effect" as a negative feedback loop is a sophisticated point
- ✅ **Strong Examples:** You used relevant examples (megacities in Asia) and well-explained hypothetical scenarios (parks as flood buffers) to effectively support your claims

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- ❌ The essay structure could be clearer - it reads more like a discussion than a clear agree/disagree response

---

### **Coherence and Cohesion: Band 8.0** 🔗

Your essay's structure is flawless.

#### **Strengths:**
- ✅ **Logical Progression:** The four-paragraph structure works perfectly. You clearly state your position after logically arguing against the opposing view and then for your own
- ✅ **Clear Paragraphing:** Each body paragraph has a very clear central theme (drawbacks of housing vs. benefits of parks), making your essay extremely easy to follow

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- ❌ Some transition phrases could be more varied to enhance flow

---

### **Lexical Resource (Vocabulary): Band 7.5** 💬

You demonstrated an excellent and wide range of vocabulary.

#### **Strengths:**
- ✅ You used sophisticated and precise terms like `vacant spaces`, `eco-friendly facilities`, `heating effect`, `vehicle emission`, `mitigate`, `buffer`, `threshold`, and `habitats`

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- ❌ `different point of views` (should be `points of view`)
- ❌ `oftenly` (should be `often`)
- ❌ `use conditioner` (should be `use air conditioning`)
- ❌ `pounds` (should be `ponds`)

### **Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 6.0** ⚠️

This is, once again, the one area holding you back. Your essay is like a powerful sports car with a world-class engine (your ideas) and a perfect chassis (your structure), but the steering is loose (your sentence control).

#### **The Problem:**
- ❌ You have completely abandoned the "short sentence discipline" again. Your body paragraphs are built on extremely long, multi-clause sentences
- ❌ These long sentences become convoluted and contain errors

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- ❌ **Example Error:** "Therefore, citizens are forced to use conditioner to cool their living place while at the same time, emit more heating gas out, and result in a damaging negative infinite loop, which can eventually cause deaths, especially in summer."
- ❌ This sentence strings too many ideas together, losing clarity and control

## 🚀 **Action Plan for Improvement**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Apply Sentence Diet:** Break complex ideas into shorter, clearer, more controlled sentences
2. **Fix Vocabulary Errors:** Review and correct common word choice mistakes
3. **Strengthen Position:** Make your agree/disagree stance clearer from the introduction

### **Long-term Goals:**
1. **Master Sentence Control:** Practice writing complex ideas in simple, clear sentences
2. **Expand Transition Vocabulary:** Learn more varied linking phrases
3. **Consistent Practice:** Apply the "25-word max" rule to improve grammatical accuracy

## 💡 **Key Learning Points**

- **Your Ideas:** Band 8+ quality - sophisticated arguments about urban heat islands and biodiversity
- **Your Structure:** Excellent organization with clear paragraphing
- **Your Mission:** Focus on sentence control to match your excellent ideas with flawless grammar

### **Sentence Surgery Example:**

#### **Your Original (Problem):**
> "Therefore, citizens are forced to use conditioner to cool their living place while at the same time, emit more heating gas out, and result in a damaging negative infinite loop, which can eventually cause deaths, especially in summer."

#### **"Diet" Version (Solution):**
> "Therefore, citizens are forced to use air conditioning to cool their living spaces. However, this action simultaneously emits more heat outside. This results in a damaging negative feedback loop, which can eventually cause heat-related deaths, especially in summer."

**By breaking your one long sentence into three shorter, more focused ones, the idea becomes more impactful, the logic is clearer, and the grammatical errors disappear.**
