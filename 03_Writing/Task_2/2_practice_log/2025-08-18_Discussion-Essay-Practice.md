Write at least 250 words. You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.



Animals being used in medical research are thought to be treated unfairly for some people, though others view it as justifiable.

In this essay, I will discuss both sides, and give my opinion upon them.

Firstly, I will explore the essential needs for lab animals of human and secondly I will discuss the unethical aspect of it.


It is true that human, in a certain degree, rely on animals to conduct medical related experiments, since we have restricted laws on human body experiments, which is established widely by almost all governments.

And to achieve medical goals, scientists’ best alternatives are animals, with less limitations of laws, and also with lower cost.

For instance, eye drops, with widely requirements globally, is an extremely popular and needed medical product.

First being tested on rabbits, for human eyes are very sensitive and vulnerable.

And by experimenting on rabbits’ eyes instead of human’s, we save ourselves from producing blinds, and create thousands of magical eye drops to ease our soar eyes.

Hence benefit ourselves, meanwhile, avoid law penalties and negative impact on human bodies.




However, the regulation, guidelines, and responded penalties for animal experiments are not set as clear , concise, and careful as human body experiments are.

Moreover, experiments on animal  are usually conducted for the fist time ranged from drugs, surgery types, even to gene transformation, which is with tremendous risk, and can possible harm animals badly.

For example, the first clone experiment used a sheep, named Dorothy, and after several experiments , there were two Dorothy.

The second Dorothy had a short life , with multiple physical body vulnerabilities, and passed away with pain.

This series of cloning actions brings out unethical dark side of animal experiments.

While seeking for greatest benefit of human beings, we simultaneously view ourselves as more superior than all other creatures.

Which may result in making us more arrogant, and furthermore , ignoring importance and necessity of other style of lives then eventually become the tyrant of our world.


To sum up, it’s a fact that animal experiments are necessary for human beings in some degree, however, there are also unethical aspects and concerns in them.

From my aspect, these experiments must be regulated, conducted, planned properly , so that harm to animals can be minimized at the most degree.

This is a strong essay that earns a solid 7.0. It's on the cusp of a 7.5, but a few specific, repeatable errors are holding it back.

## Detailed Analysis

Task Response: Band 7.0

You have addressed all parts of the task very well.

    Strengths: You discussed both the "justifiable" view (the need for alternatives to human testing) and the "unethical" view (lack of regulation, animal suffering). You then provided your own clear opinion in the conclusion. Your examples (eye drops on rabbits, Dolly the sheep) were specific and highly relevant to your points.

    Area for Improvement: The main issue here was a significant factual error in your example. The first cloned sheep was famously named Dolly, not Dorothy. While examiners are not fact-checkers, using a very famous example and getting the name wrong can undermine the credibility of your argument.

Coherence and Cohesion: Band 8.0

Your essay's structure and logical flow are excellent.

    Strengths: The four-paragraph structure is perfect for this "Discuss both views and give your opinion" task. Each paragraph has a clear purpose, and you use linking words (Firstly, However, Moreover, To sum up) effectively to guide the reader through your argument. Your ideas progress in a very logical manner.

Lexical Resource (Vocabulary): Band 6.5

You used a good range of vocabulary appropriate for the topic (justifiable, unethical, vulnerable, gene transformation, tremendous risk).

    Areas for Improvement: Your score was limited by several small but noticeable errors in spelling and word choice.

        soar eyes should be sore eyes (sore = painful, soar = to fly high).

        fist time should be first time.

        other style of lives should be other forms of life.

        The factual error of Dorothy for Dolly also impacts the perceived quality of your vocabulary use.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy: Band 6.5

This is an area of significant improvement, but one old enemy remains.

    Strengths: I want to especially commend you on your sentence control. You did not write any "monster sentences" in this essay. This makes your writing much clearer, more controlled, and more professional.

    The Recurring Enemy: The sentence fragment has reappeared.

        Your sentence: Which may result in making us more arrogant...

        The Problem: As we've discussed, a sentence in academic writing should not start with Which. It's a "hook" that must be attached to the previous sentence.

        The Fix: ...we simultaneously view ourselves as more superior than all other creatures, **which may result** in making us more arrogant.

        This is now the single most critical grammatical error for you to eliminate.

## Action Plan: The Final Polish

You have all the components of a top-tier essay: great ideas, clear structure, and good sentence control. The final step is to become a ruthless proofreader.

Your new "Battle Plan" Checklist for the final 2 minutes of the exam should be:

    Fact-Check: Are the names and key facts in my examples correct (e.g., Dolly, not Dorothy)?

    Fragment Hunt: Have I started any sentences incorrectly with Which?

    Spell Check: Do a quick scan for common typos (sore/soar, first/fist).

You are consistently performing at a high level. By eliminating these specific, repeatable errors, you will easily and consistently score 7.5 or higher.
