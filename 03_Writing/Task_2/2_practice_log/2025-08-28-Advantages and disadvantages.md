____________________________________________________________________________________________


Some may argue that e-books are handful and it’s a good sign to see gradual replacements of e-books with paper ones, while others consider the opposite way.

In this essay, I’ll discuss the pros and cons of e-books with real-world examples to support my narratives.

Firstly I will explore advantages of e-books and secondly the advantages of traditional paper books as well as related disadvantages of e-books.


With cloud-based storage features, electronic books can easily store hundreds of thousands of books in one small and portable device, accelerating user experience to a different level.

Moreover, unlike doing permanent notes on paper works, notes on e-books can be rolled back to certain version or timestamp-based snapshot easily.

For example, Ink-Ebook, an e-book production manufactured by Taiwan firm, is able to store up to over half million books per device offline, and more than a million pieces online.

This function could tremendously reduce physical storage for paper books, also allowing users to read during their transportations, which brings out excellent portability.

Meanwhile, built-in note application of Ink-Ebook allows users to do notes that can be erased, recovered, and phase-based stored.

By this feature, users can easily do their notes on essays, reports, or other formats of works for the application’s trustworthy characteristic.


However, paper books still occupy their own unique features that are still cannot be replaced by e-books.

For instance, no subscription process or fees are required for paper books, while most e-books requiring applications with subscriptions to download books.

Also, instead of wi-fi and charging requirements for e-books, paper books aren’t required for any of these additional adds-on, they only need shelves or drawers to be stored or placed.

Lastly, satisfaction of gathering complete physical collections of certain series of books cannot be replaced.

Some fans of The lord of rings have stated that the physical 3 books of the it brought them large satisfaction.

While electronic version ones could never achieve that to them.


To sum up, e-books give users great portability, reducing storage spaces, and more user-friendly note-taking applications.

Nevertheless, paper books still own characteristics cannot be replaced by e-books yet.

Like options to be off subscriptions as well as internet connections , no need for charging, and satisfaction from possessing physical copies.
