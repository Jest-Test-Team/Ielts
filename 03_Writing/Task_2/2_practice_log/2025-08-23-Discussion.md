## ‚úçÔ∏è **Student Essay**


### **Introduction**
It is argued that charity organizations should only be opened to citizens live in the country where they located in, while others consider boundaries should't be concerns or limitations.

This essay will explore both sides of this topic, and give real-world examples plus my own opinions toward both aspects.

Firstly, I will discuss first perspective, charity organizations should consider country boundaries, and secondly the opposite, charity organizations should never consider country boundaries.


### **Body Paragraph 1: Arguments for Domestic Focus**
It is crystal clear that all types of resources are limited due to physical or technical issues, hence distributions and allocations of resources reasonable could be be a complex topic for charity organizations.

More over, international cross border transportation of resources like water, food, and clothes, can cause lots of extra money rather than resources itself, not to mention generating tremendous carbon footprints.

**Example:** For instance, Mercy and Helping of Taiwan Buddha organization, a charity organizations based in Taiwan, kept donating materials like canned oil, packed rice, and bottle water worth millions of dollars to areas in Africa like Somaliland every year.

However, according to their official annual reports, these materials are transported in cargo ships, and could be damaged in a certain degree, which caused lots of waste.

Besides that, aircrafts are used to deliver these cargos, though the degree of cargo damage will be sharply declined, the carbon footprint will rocket and the cost can be extremely unreasonable.


### **Body Paragraph 2: Arguments for Global Aid**
However, if allocation and distribution of materials and cargos used for charity can be more systematically efficient, then cross border supporting can be fairly possible and worth executing.

Furthermore with optimized allocation and distribution method, and architecture of organization, relationships with different countries can be even tighter via charities.

**Example:** For instance, about ten years ago, when Japan experienced a severe damage from tsunami, some religion based charity groups, which already occupied connection web with religion groups located in Japan as well as established branch in that country, responded in-time extremely fast.

Also, with co-shared information with their collaborating Japanese partner, these Taiwanese religion based charity groups, used military battle ships, private firms that was scheduled to visit Japan, and tourism visiting Japan about that time period.

And by these actions, almost no extra costs are wasted, and since these actions were taken in time, all the supporting material remained fresh and useable, contributed by the well structured connection web and distribution nodes of these charity organizations in both countries.


### **Conclusion**
To sum up, it's a very complicated topic with layers of entanglements for charity organizations to execute cross border supporting, including financial and environmental issues, at least.

However, in my point of view, by establishing well designed communication web and sufficient nodes with supporting functions, these concerns could be solved, at least partially

And even unite residents in multiple countries resulting in more positive effects.
