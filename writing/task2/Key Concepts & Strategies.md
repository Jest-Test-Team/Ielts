IELTS Writing Task 2: Key Concepts & Strategies

This guide covers the essential elements for structuring a high-scoring IELTS Writing Task 2 essay, from sentence construction to advanced stylistic techniques.

I. Essay & Sentence Structure

A clear structure is crucial. An essay should follow a logical progression, using a variety of sentence types to demonstrate grammatical range.

Essay Structure

A standard high-scoring essay contains four paragraphs:

    Introduction:

        Paraphrase: Restate the essay question in your own words.

        Thesis Statement: Clearly state your position or what the essay will discuss.

        Outline: Briefly mention the main points you will cover.

    Body Paragraph 1:

        Topic Sentence: Introduce the first main idea.

        Explanation: Explain the point in more detail.

        Example: Provide a specific example to support your point.

    Body Paragraph 2:

        Topic Sentence: Introduce the second main idea.

        Explanation: Explain the point in more detail.

        Example: Provide a specific example to support your point.

    Conclusion:

        Summary: Briefly summarize your main points.

        Final Opinion: Restate your thesis in different words.

Sentence Structure

Vary your sentences to show grammatical flexibility.

    Compound Sentences: Link two independent clauses with a conjunction.

        Conjunctions: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so (FANBOYS), as well as linking words like however, therefore, and furthermore.

        Example: "Many students work part-time, so they often have less time for their studies."

    Complex Sentences: Combine an independent clause with one or more dependent clauses.

        Example: "Many teenagers have a part-time job, which is often poorly paid, to save extra money."

II. Advanced Writing Techniques (Band 7+)

To achieve a higher score, incorporate these stylistic and grammatical features.

Hedging (Cautious Language) ‚úçÔ∏è

Hedging makes your claims sound more academic and less absolute.

    Method 1: Adverbs of Frequency

        Words: often, usually, generally, typically

        Example: "Online shopping generally offers more convenience."

    Method 2: Modal Verbs

        Words: might, could, may, should

        Example: "Investing in renewable energy could help mitigate climate change."

    Method 3: Introductory Phrases

        Phrases: It is believed that..., Some argue that..., It could be argued that...

        Example: "It could be argued that strict regulations can mitigate social media's negative effects."

The Passive Voice üèõÔ∏è

Use the passive voice to create a more formal and objective tone.

    When to Use:

        When the action is more important than the actor (e.g., "New policies were implemented.").

        When stating general facts or processes (e.g., "It is known that plastic pollutes the oceans.").

        When expressing a general opinion (e.g., "It is often said that travel broadens the mind.").

III. Vocabulary & Linking Words

Using precise vocabulary and smooth transitions is essential for a high score in Lexical Resource and Coherence.

Discourse Markers (Linking Words) üîó

Use these to guide the reader through your arguments. Avoid overusing them at the start of every sentence.

    Addition: Moreover, Furthermore, In addition

    Contrast: However, On the other hand, In contrast

    Result: Therefore, Consequently, As a result

Phrasal Verbs ‚ú®

Well-used phrasal verbs make your language sound more natural.

    Bring about: to cause something to happen.

    Carry out: to perform a task.

    Look into: to investigate.

    Point out: to draw attention to a fact.

    Set out: to present ideas clearly.

Topic-Specific Vocabulary üéØ

Using precise words related to the topic shows your lexical range.

    Environment: conservation, eco-friendly, endangered species, fossil fuels, global warming.

    Education: attainment, hands-on experience, vocational training, curriculum, pedagogy.

    Technology: cutting-edge, intuitive design, social media, a technological breakthrough.
